I am interested in creating some SOAP web service client applications using Cocoa.  I have WSDL files that describe the interfaces to the service methods.  Doing some investigation with Google and on the Apple Developer web site I came across the following options.  

   1 Apple WebService Framework.
   2 C/C++ gSoap Class Library.

I am wondering if anyone has a recommended solution.  None of the above options really seem suited for developing clients in Cocoa.  They just don't have an Objective-C feel to them.
