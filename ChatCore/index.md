Proteus also has its chat services available, although I know nothing about them.

*Proteus's imservices is a daemon for insulation from the GPL.  It used to incorporate libfaim (AIM-TOC), libfiretalk (AIM-OSCAR), libgg (Gadu-Gadu), libicq2000, libjabber, libyahoo, libyahoo2, msnlib, and Proton's Proteus Plugin (which was RendezVous Plugin for Proteus before TIBCO's lawyers heard of it); version 4 uses libgaim, presumably replacing most of the above.  The source is supposed to be available at indigofield.com via SubVersion and ViewCVS, neither of which I've ever seen working.*

And of course XChat Aqua's source is available - http://xchataqua.sourceforge.net/

A backup copy of Acid, a jabber library written in Cocoa is available here (since it isn't hosted on jabberstudio.org anymore)
