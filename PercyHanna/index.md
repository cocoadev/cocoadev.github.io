I work at http://www.sevenlight.com/, as the lead developer for their easy-to-use CMS.  Exploring Cocoa development as a hobby and possible future business avenue.  My real name is Andrew Hanna, Percy is my middle name (Percival).

Started new company, http://www.burn37.com/, to develop my first (and more future) Mac/iPhone app, a video guestbook application called GuestReel (http://www.guestreel.com/).
