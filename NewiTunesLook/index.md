Not sure if anyone has discovered this yet, but has anyone learned how Apple pulled off the new look for iTunes 5? I guess it could be some custom stuff, but just wanted to check to see if there is any discussion out there of possiblities. Thanks in advance!

It's all Carbon stuff, so probably way unrelated to Cocoa UI.
