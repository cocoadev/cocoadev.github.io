Is this book up to date enough that it would help the reader write different types of object oriented programs specifically using Objective-C and Cocoa?

Absolutely. This book is well-written and a good foundation. Most recent books on the topic just add to it, and refer to it constantly. Specifically, if you're writing object-oriented programs, you need to read this book. -- MichaelMcCracken

*Additionally I am quite sure the authors looked toward ObjectiveC and NeXTStep when they wrote the book. Remember that in 2009, Cocoa is 20+ years old.  Cocoa is the evolution of NeXTstep which shipped commercially in 1988.*

Moreover the book uses examples written in SmallTalk (as well as C++), which is very close to ObjC.

There is a Cocoa specific design patterns book:
