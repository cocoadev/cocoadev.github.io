Hello, I'm currently running 10.3 and have run into a problem. I am trying to get the colour of a certain pixel, now unfortunately -[NSBitmapImageRep colorAtX:y:] doesn't exist in 10.3 and neither does -[NSBitmapImageRep getPixel:atX:y:] even though it doesn't state that.

Is there any conceivable way that I could achieve the same effect easily? Or would it be too hard for it to be a bother?
