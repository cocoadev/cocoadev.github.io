Welcome! Now can you provide an English phonetic pronunciation key for your name? ;-)
----
well.. I have no idea how to do that, but if I were to write it so it sounded right in english it'd be something like "Fjulnir Owsgayrsson" :)
----
Neither do I, so here's it in audio: http://fjolnir.okoru.org/files/myname.mov

I won't even attempt to say that name out loud ;)
