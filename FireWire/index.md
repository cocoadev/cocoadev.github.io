title: FireWire
---

High-speed serial connectivity standard developed by Apple. Also known as IEEE-1394 or iLink. (Sony started calling it iLink while Apple was deciding whether or not to make the name "FireWire" public. Of course, calling it iLink in general would have an even worse effect for Apple, so FireWire is now a public name for IEEE-1394. Of course, it's too late now; many PC peripherals call it iLink/IEEE-1394, with no mention of FireWire)
