Does anyone know where to find the Aqua Icon Kit?  It used to be located at:

http://developer.apple.com/ue/aqua/resources/AquaIconKit1.1.dmg.bin 

But it is not there anymore.  I've been searching for it but every page I have come across that mentions it only has a link to the aforementioned address.

I recently emailed the ADC about this, and from what they tell me, the icon kit has been pulled for revisions.

Whew, thanks for the link from aeolic.com. I grabbed it, and I put it on my site. It's pretty small and probably low-traffic, so I'll post the link here in case the aeolic.com link is not available:

http://mikeash.com/AquaIconKit1.1.dmg

I'll leave that up probably forever, because it's pretty likely that I'll forget the file is there before I remember to delete it.

Available at my site as well, in case the above links go down:

I'm just waiting for the resolution-independent version... *drool* :)
