How do you perform reverse engineering on Cocoa applications? 
I just found a very good guide on this subject at http://culater.net/wiki/moin.cgi/CocoaReverseEngineering

Is there any way to know what class is behind a particular UI element of MyApp?

*If it's a nib-based app, open the nib. Or you could run strings and/or class-dump on the app executable to find out the class names*

Yeah... that's what I thought.  How do I run a class dump?

Get it at [http://www.codethecode.com/Projects/class-dump/] and just run it on the executable.
This is cited on the ClassDump page

Or even better, use FScriptAnywhere.

And read about InputManager
