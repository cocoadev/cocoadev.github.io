Perhaps the most powerful framework in TheOmniGroup's entire framework suite, OWF, otherwise known as the Omni Web Framework, provides an advanced architecture within which to write multithreaded, internet applications. OWF is the work horse in OmniWeb controlling all of the content fetching, HTML/SGML parsing, FTP server manipulation, etc. If OmniFoundation is the Objective-C programmer's Swiss Army Knife, then OWF is their double barrel, rotary laser cannon. 

Want to write a quick app to fetch stock prices from www.fakestocksite.com? OWF practically already does it. Need to fetch and parse a credit report from the credit bureau in your e-commerce site? Sprinkle in some custom logic and the OWF fairy does the rest. In the next version we plan on integrating back scratching and toast making.
