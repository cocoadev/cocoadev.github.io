I'm 20 years old and a computer science major at the University of Kansas in Lawrence.

My major Cocoa project is Schoolhouse, a student homework management app. I've recently been working with Ruby and Python a lot more, which are wonderful languages as well.

I was an Apple Intern last summer at the mothership...which was awesome. I worked in the Mac OS X building a software testing automation solution. I'm going back this summer and can't wait.
