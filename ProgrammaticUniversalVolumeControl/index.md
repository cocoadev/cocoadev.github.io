  What system call is responsible for getting and setting the universal system volume (the one that changes wth the menu extra, not an application specific colume like the iTunes slider)?  I'd like to make a module to do this from QuickSilver (for those who don't have vol-control keys - is there a way to enable this fn-key function on non-*books?), or for those who simply like QS for almost everything (like me)
