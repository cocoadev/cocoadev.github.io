Ex-NeXT...

(and Mark R. Onyschuk - hence the convenient nick :)

I'm working independently once again, aiming to release a new application this August. If you need a hand with any sticky Cocoa UI issues, give me a shout; I've been working with Cocoa and its predecessor frameworks since 1992 or thereabouts! I'm sure I could make some time to help out at reasonable cost.

I can be reached at mailto:mark.onyschuk@gmail.com (while we switch ISPs).
