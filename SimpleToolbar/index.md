SimpleToolbar is a small Xcode project containing code and resources for creating and handling a toolbar in Cocoa. It�s functionality is similar to ADC�s ToolbarSample, but has been designed to be easier to import into an existing project, by separating the toolbar�s code and resources from the window�s.

In other words, it's basically a Cocoa Application project with an added delegate class for the toolbar. It's not as elegant as GenericToolbar, but nice for people who like to tweak their code manually.
