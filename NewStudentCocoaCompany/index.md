Are there any students out there interested in setting up a new company for developing funky, innovative cocoa software? The purpose of which would be purely to fund our degrees, and assist other students fund theirs through cocoa development.--LukeSands

How would things like ownership be handled? The way you describe it, the scope could be huge. Is this merely a marketing company for independent projects, or would all of the students work on the same project, and split the profit?

interestedCount++; I'd be in depending on the project

----

I think it could potentially offer both marketing & support for independent projects and the opportunity to develop apps collectively and split the profit. Collective apps would be owned by the company for ease of profit sharing. Independent projects obviously retaining ownership.

Once the company has a few successful apps under its belt or can find other financial backing, I envisage being able to offer free or subisidised services to other students. Perhaps in the form of web hosting, payment processing and generic code frameworks.

Count me in, going to college next year and I'll need all the cash I can get. Could it also promote application we've developed on our own as well as products the "company" has created? -MichaelBianco

This sounds great to me too, if we can actually get it organized. I'd love to be able to replace my TA job with something like this. :-) -KevinPerry

----

Sounds cool. I've already got an app in the queue, and this will be cool. I've also found that my professors are a good resource for ideas for apps, and they can often beta-test when they aren't busy. If you're struggling for ideas for apps, just ask people what kinds of problems they have, and try to give them a solution with an app. -- JasonTerhorst

----

I'd be very interested too. Still starting with Cocoa, and currently have a day job - Java (J2EE) what i really would like to change to Cocoa and finally get a time for degree and money to fund it. :) -- ArnisVuskans

----

Count me in. I have a job as a java programmer now, but I can't maintain that once I head off to college. Organization and drive are the keys here, but it sounds like it could be awesome :).

Sounds nice, perhaps we should have a collaberation tool in order to dish-out assignments (yes, plenty enough in school... It builds character). I for one would love to participate, but not at the expense of actual school-work. So if there was some way to just pick up an assignment, and then hand it in with your name on it, that would be sweet. Then I can pick things I am good at, and avoid my weak-spots (I will save those for projects where I can accept full responsibility for errors). Anyways, _interested++.

How should we get this started? Do you want to meet in a chatroom on AIM or something? On IRC?
-MichaelBianco

----

What's a time that everyone can meet? Saturday is probably the best day for me. We should make sure we come with several ideas as well so we don't have to brainstorm as much then.

----

I think a collaberation tool to allow each member to assign themselves component tasks would be a great idea. It would be good to have a chat about this in iChat sometime, although thats going to be difficult to arrange with us all in different time zones. Ideally, we need a private wiki or forum to discuss the first steps - getting a website done, and application concepts. --LukeSands

----

Saturday sounds good for me.
About the wiki/forum. I have plenty of space & bandwidth of my server (I even have SVN set up). I could set up a wiki and/or forum on a subdomain so we could easily communicate.
Let me know what you think.
-MichaelBianco

----

That's an excellent idea Michael, though I think we should stick with iChat for Saturday to facilitate quick exchange of ideas. The forum would be useful for logging the important bits from the chats and the wiki could hold everything else. 

What's a good time on Saturday? I'd prefer something like 3-4 PM PST. Are most of us located on the west coast? [KevinPerry]

----
I wish, I'm in NY.  But 6-7 PM EST works fine for me.

----

I'm in PA. 6-7 PM EST works good for me too. -MichaelBianco

----

Would it be useful to make a list of interested parties? I think it would, so here:


*KevinPerry
*JeremyJurksztowicz
*JacobFraimow (I'm EST and I'm pretty sure I can make it)
*JasonTerhorst - I'm not able to join the meeting, is there going to be a transcript made available here afterwards?
*MichaelBianco
*LukeSands (reachable at first_lastname@hotmail.com)


You should probably also indicate here if you won't be able to make it on Saturday to the iChat.

--We can make a transcript available via whatever kind of website/forum/wiki we decide we're going to use.

----
If it's helpful I have an unused domain name + server space at operation-ninja.org (well, it was used but that experiment kind of failed) that could be made useful. 

Edit: foolish me. I kinda skimmed the updates and didn't even notice MichaelBianco 's offer. Whichever works best for everyone. I just think operation-ninja is a cool name =P -JacobFraimow

----
If you're going to be there on Saturday, we can compare what you and MichaelBianco can offer and pick the best between the two.

We might as well specify now when and where exactly we're going to meet, since most of us seem to be available at the above time:


*Where: iChat (AIM) chat room "cocoadevstudents"
*When: Saturday, June 10 2006 - 3PM PST (6PM EST/11PM BST)
*What: Get this "company" thing started. Come with plenty of ideas for apps and ways to organize development!


Proposed Agenda:

*Introductions
*Discuss goals
*Assess resources
*Discuss project ideas
*Make action items and assignments

Feel free to add or rearrange anything in this list.

Whats happend to this project then?

Looks like they got suspended. :-)

Shame looked like it would have been a good project to watch develop
