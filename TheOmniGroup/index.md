The Omni Group is the creator of General/OmniWeb, General/OmniGraffle, General/OmniOutliner, and other applications for Mac OS X.  Omni also does custom development and consulting. Their tools for developers include free software (including much of the source code used in our own products), such as General/OmniFrameworks, General/OmniObjectMeter (a tool that makes it easy for Cocoa and Unix developers to find and fix performance issues), and noise-controlled mailing lists on a variety of programming topics.

(These guys are geek gods. Plus, they make General/OmniWeb. They rock. -- General/RobRix)

All hail The Omni Group! (Can I have a job when I graduate? -- General/BrentGulanowski)

I want one too! :D

[i want: job[programmer omnigroup]];

That's strange Objective-C syntax. :)

Maybe . . .

    
BOOL gotJob = General/[[ASPerson currentPerson] wantsJob:General/ASProgrammerJob
                                       atCompany:General/[ASCompany companyWithString: @"General/OmniGroup"]];
*//nice, but you can't always get what you want ;)*

if (gotJob) {
  General/NSLog(@"Hooray!");
} else {
  General/NSLog(@"Oh foo.");
}


 . . . would work better? (You'll have to learn how to program in General/ObjC better if you want a programmer job at The Omni Group :)

You guys are great. You got my **Mom** to enjoy using computers, with General/OmniWeb. I would also want a job. --General/JoshaChapmanDodson

General/OmniGroup sucks lately.

Agreed, they seem to have lost their magic. Maybe firing Matas was a bad idea?

*They fired him? Are you sure, or did he just leave to join Delicious?*

They didn't explicitly fire him, but they basically said he wasn't welcome any longer.

It's good to see that he's welcome at Apple.

----

How have they lost their magic?  Also to the poster that just says, "General/OmniGroup sucks lately," I think a why would be in order. Statements without background are just words with little meaning.

Personally, I have seen all their products improve over the last 2 years.  Since I use and own 3 of them , Graffle, Outliner, Web, I see nothing wrong with the quality or innovation.  I would love for them start thinking about new applications, like a great street mapping application.

----

Their latest apps simply don't give me that "wow" feeling. I believe General/OmniWeb 5 was their last cool app with innovations - keeping the tabbed websites in a drawer for example. The newest versions of General/OmniOutliner and soon to be released General/OmniGraffle seem way too complex and complicated for their own good. 

----

I agree - the new icons and user interfaces on General/OmniOutliner and General/OmniGraffle look really, really poor compared to the General/UIs in the older releases. It's sad, but amazing, how much of an effect an application's icon makes to whether you want to use it anymore...

*This will have to be one of those things that people will just keep an eye on, then.... If Omni doesn't do so well in the next couple of years, then we'll have a teaching tool for lessons on running a software company. Learn from the mistakes of others, eh? Mike Matas was probably the best icon guy they could have had, and Apple has him now.*
