Hello. I was trying to make an app that disabled the CGS for a game so that I could put a window in front of it. (Like an iChat or something). I have looked at the documentation for if, but I cannot figure it out. Please help me.

Thanks in advance,

Only the owner of the shielding window can release it.

----

Any idea on how I could do that?

You could look into ApplicationEnhancer and use it to release the window when needed.

Now I use this program for other applications, but I have never developed on it before. Also, I don't really like having people download other applications to get the software to work. Is there a way I can take part of it and use it in my program, of course giving all the proper credits.
