Does anybody know where SaverLab 1.7+ can be downloaded?  The dozingcat site no longer exists!  Anybody have the original dmg they want to share?  If so, please email it to:
crypticcaveman@yahoo.com

Thanks!

Thanks to a quick search, I've found an old version (1.5) at http://www.tucows.com/preview/209499 . It seems to work fine on Tiger. I'll keep looking for 1.7+, but in the mean time this should help. --JediKnil

I'm the author of SaverLab. I'll check out the domain problem tonight and hopefully have it back up shortly.

I've updated the link to point to the current dozingcat site: [http://www.dozingcatsoftware.com/] - cosmo at codefetch
