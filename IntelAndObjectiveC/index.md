Since Intel's compilers don't compile the Objective-C language, does this mean I have to learn C++ to write applications for the Mac? Or does Apple have a compiler which compiles Objective-C for Intel's processors?

XCode can produce Intel code just fine.  You don't need to learn anything new.

It would be very inconvenient and require much more porting if you had to use a new language.

Enough already. The question has been answered.
