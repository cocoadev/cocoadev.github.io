title: CoreDataAndNSObjectController

I have a number of CoreData entities that I've bound to a table using bindings and an NSArrayController. When I doubleclick on this table, the selected entity is sent to a FocusedEntity class. Thing is, I want to be able to display the content and the attributes of that FocusedEntity class until I doubleclick on another entry in the table.

I gather I need to use NSObjectController somehow, but I can't figure out what to do with it. Anyone have experience with this?

----Yes I do, and you will too, if you follow one of the Core Data tutorials like http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/coredatatutorial/index.html or http://www.cocoadevcentral.com/articles/000085.php or http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/NSPersistentDocumentTutorial/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001799----
