I'm new to cocoa programming and I've been browsing through tutorials for hours but they all seem to talk about specific issues for people who already use cocoa - is there any beginner tutorial to help me through building a simple program with GUI...?

This page is one of those such that, if it didn't exist, it would have to be invented, and would be, sooner or later. As such it is a canonical page title, like General/NewbieProblem or General/WhereToStart. If it gets deleted, somebody will reinvent it.

If you are just General/GettingStarted, that page is a good jumping off point. If you feel you have special needs that aren't covered there, or if you're becoming aware of the vastness and flexibility of Cocoa and General/ObjectiveC, feel free to post your insights or just dish a little, below:
