CocoaDiscussions - Making a browser that downloads files

Cocoa newbie here. I'm playing around with the Web Kit framework and need to know how I can control how files are download (via FTP). This includes the interface, such as the estimated progress in downloading. If anyone could point me to the right class, that would be great.

Thanks!

(EDIT: I'll orphan this because I've realized Web Kit doesn't even handle this!)
