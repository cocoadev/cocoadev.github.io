Well, seems like I'm the project lead of OpenGroupware.org until I can pass over the job to someone more qualified and concentrate on development tasks ;-)

Besides that, I'm also the CEO (hear, hear) of ZideOne, a company which develops a WebDAV store for Outlook.

Please send me mail at mailto:me@helgehess.eu.

My homepage is: http://www.helgehess.eu/

Things I have done:
 
 * GETobjects, a WebObjects like Java application server
 * SOPE, a WebObjects compatible Objective-C application server
 * GroupDAV, vCard and iCalendar records over WebDAV, small protocol
 * ZideStore, server side MAPI implementation and frontend to OGo
 * OpenGroupware.org / SKYRiX, a groupware server
 * skyrix-xml, a SAX, DOM and XmlRpc framework for Foundation/Objective-C
 * libFoundation, currently maintained by me
 * NGJavaScript, a bridge for Objective-C and the SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine
 * NGPython, a Python bridge for GNUstep
 * GTKKit, an AppKit-lookalike gtk+ wrapper
 * NGAntlr, some ANTLR2 support for Objective-C
 * gstep-make, some hacks to support compilation on Windows
 * mod_objc, software to allow Apache modules written in Objective-C
