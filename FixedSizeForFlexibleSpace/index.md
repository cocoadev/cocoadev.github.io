Mail (in Tiger and Leopard) has a unique feature for it's toolbar, in that the first specified flexible space item is always as wide as the mailboxes pane. This is nice in that it makes sure that the first 'real' toolbar item is always in line with your content pane. It's taken a step further in Leopard in that even if there is buttons before it, it will still stop after it hits that point. Does anybody know of an easy way to do this? Thanks, --LoganCollins
