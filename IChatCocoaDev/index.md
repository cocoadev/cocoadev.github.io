Any one interested in populating an iChat chat room  called CocoaDev? For more really time discussions. And if it becomes popular it could be mentioned on the home page?

just an idea.

Last time I checked there was an iChat ChatRoom called "cocoadev". In fact, it was even on the home page [http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?CocoaDev50]. I may pop-in every now and then. -- RyanBates
