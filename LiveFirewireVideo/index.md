Where would I start if I wanted to get live video from a firewire camera? If any one knows of any source or documentation that would help that'd be awsesome. There seems to be the same video input dialog in various applications so im assuming theres a system call of sorts.

Thanks for any help in advance!

I believe video capture is handled by QuickTime.
