The short discussion that was here was moved into NS_MenuItem_Discussion, where it is more on-topic.

Suggest this page can be kept useful by being given some material related to basic problems with the document architecture or some such, and given a link from the CommonProblem page or perhaps some other intro page.

e.g. craft a couple of sentences about implementing     dataRepresentationOfType: ( NSString * ) type
or     fileWrapperRepresentationOfType:  ( NSString * ) type

(For example, I was tripped up as a beginner by not picking up on the fact that you must implement ONLY one or the other.)

Or: problem may be with using <NSCoding> or with use of NSArchiver itself. Refer to useful pages...

Just a list of common trouble-shooting strategies for helping beginners with saving and archiving issues.
