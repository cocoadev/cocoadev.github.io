I'm wondering where I should start using IDEKit?

*In your apps? At home? At work? Look at the example project that comes with it? What are you asking?*

What is IDEKit?  Build your own RealBasic ?

It's a fairly decent LGPL framework for writing a code editor (with a line number gutter, syntax coloring, etc) in Cocoa/GNUstep. [http://homepage.mac.com/gandreas/FileSharing.html]

IDEKit seems to be dead, and is no longer accessible at the link above.  If someone has a copy, please mirror it somewhere (SourceForge?).

Are there any **alternatives** to the IDEKit framework that provides SyntaxHighlighting without diving into all the coding procedures?

*Theres UKSyntaxColoredTextDocument in ObjectLibraryViews. There's a lot of sample code around, but that's the only other one I know of that doesn't require doing most of the work yourself. I'm thinking about working on a class to parse SubEthaEdit syntax definition files, but secretly hoping someone beats me to it. ;)*

*Take a look at HighlighterKit.  It is relatively small and appears to do SyntaxHighlighting only.*
