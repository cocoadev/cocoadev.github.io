Doug Knowles has been a Mac developer since 1984 and a programmer since... well, never mind.  I have never owned a Wintel machine.

My Mac efforts that have seen the light of day include Lotus 1-2-3 for Macintosh and Symantec C++ for PowerMac (version 8).  There are other things I'm proud of, but I'm sick of co-workers saying "I was in grade school then".

Currently working in Java when I can.
