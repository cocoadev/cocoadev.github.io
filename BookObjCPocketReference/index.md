*All I can say is that Obj-C becomes terribly easy to "get" after flipping through this handy guide.
*JoshaChapmanDodson -  I just bought the book on my monthly trip to Portland, OR, and it was worth the trip.
*Its a nice addition to my library. Helps a lot from not knowing anything about Objective-C (or at least I didn't before reading).
*Just got this today and intended to just glance through it, ended up spending the past 2 hours reading it from cover to cover. It really makes it clear 
*why* things work the way they do at the framework level. It's more of an introductory guide than a reference though - something to read in bed rather than keep stacked next to your monitor.
*I got this book off of ebay for a steal. It has helped me a LOT. I never quite got what was going on in Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X until i read through some of the stuff in this book. It also made it easy and fun to write apps without cocoa.

have had it for a long time. Lots of details in there, but not a book for the beginner. Pretty dense and technical. Good to read on the toilet after or while learning Objective-C. Goes into detail the beginner can not or should not be thinking about.
It's cheap though, so you can't go wrong.
