title: DesignPatternSimilarLikeServerManager

After reading the NSDocumentController, NSDocument, NSWindowController parts I am not sure if I can use this pattern for a similar design used as for the ServerManager. 
I'v got problems with this Document behaviour with the idea that I should be able to open more then one window  with different views or with a same view from a loadable NIB. I remember in the past that I did read something about this, but couldn't find it.

I'v got so far in UML.

Does someone has any suggestions.

Thanks
