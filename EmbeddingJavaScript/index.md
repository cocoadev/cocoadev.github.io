Hi. I'm curious about how to embed JavaScript in my application. I know about JavaScriptCore and SpiderMonkey and Rhino. How do I do it?

Editor's NOTE: I don't really care myself, but if you look back at the history of this page, you will see why the question has been posed. I don't *expect* it to be answered. A question asked in this manner is like asking "How much does it cost?", when the answer is, "If you have to ask, you can't afford it."  :-)
