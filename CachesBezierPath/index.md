title: CachesBezierPath

Hi I was wondering if anyone has advice on -cachesBezierPath (inside NSBezierPath).  The docs for it say:

Returns YES if this object maintains a cached image of its path; otherwise returns NO. The cached image is stored in a display user object.

I was wondering what a display user object is.  Also, when you append paths is the caching state preserved?  Are there standard ways of ensuring that all of my paths are cached?

Thank you!
