title: HowToExtractTitleFromWebArchive

What would be the easiest way to extract a page title from a web archive? Currently I create a webView, send load request and then get title in the     webView:didReceiveTitle:forFrame: delegate method. But is there any way to get the page title without loading an archive in a webView?
