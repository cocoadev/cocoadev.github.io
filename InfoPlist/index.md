The Info.plist contains important information about a bundle, be it an application, framework, plugin, etc... It is a list of key/value pairs; the values can be represented as strings, dictionaries, arrays, booleans, dates, data, or numbers. The Info.plist determines among other things: document types handled; services offered; help name and location.
