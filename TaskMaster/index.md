General/BradCox's paper describing an extensible programming system for users of all skill levels. It also includes a description of "action expressions," or General/CodeBlocks (Blocks in General/SmallTalk-80).

The paper can be found online here:

Some of the ideas it highlights are a lightweight multitasking and I/O system, and simple exception handling. General/CodeBlocks/action expressions are a potent little concept.
