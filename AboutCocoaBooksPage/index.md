Should we redesign CocoaBooks? Thing is, I never know what's changed on that page any more, it's too big.

I'm thinking a Topic, with just the picture and price in the summary of each page. The picture's kinda nice, it's a good reference, and the price is the most important initial indicator for people comparing books. We could put the buy-borrow-burn tally there too. All these comments and descriptions are probably best put on their own pages.

Yeah... When I first created this page there was only about four books, and only a couple comments here and there.  I've been thinking about re-doing the page myself for several months now.  

My plan was to list all of the books on the CocoaBooks page along with a small thumbnail, title and author, publication date, and the buy/borrow/burn counters.  I was then going to move each book to it's own page; each page would have the larger image, all of the publishing info and all of the community contributed comments.  Pages like CocoaProgrammingForMacOSX or BuildingCocoaApplicatons.  I actually OWN each and every book on the page.  I wanted to take a snapshot of them all together in a stack on the newly re-designed CocoaBooks page...

...But I'm short of spare time as of late.  Work a full time job AND on-the-side consulting too.  I'll be finished with a major side-job project in the next three weeks, and then I'll have more time to do something about it.  Or, knock yourself out and split it up as you see fit!

All done. Despite a lack of foresight on the part of whoever designed Topics on this site ::KritTer looks sheepish::, I've managed to format it reasonably intelligably on the CocoaBooks page.

I didn't think author was important enough for the summary. Its name, a visual identifier and what people thought of it seems enough.
