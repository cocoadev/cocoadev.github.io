Apple also has a gorgeous logo at http://www.apple.com/universal/, which can be licensed at http://developer.apple.com/softwarelicensing/agreements/maclogo.html. -- General/EmanueleVulcano

*I would recommend using* **apple's** *badge since it's from "the source" and is more likely to be recognized by consumers. This would otherwise be like making up your own Mac badge and using it instead of Apple's. It's not a good idea to make your own badges for another company's technology/branding/whatever.*

I noticed the logo seconds later after making this post. Yay for General/NetNewsWire and my extensive list of tech-related blogs for that. -- General/EmanueleVulcano
