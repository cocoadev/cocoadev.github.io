I've installed 12/01 Dev tools on OS 10.2.6

Project Builder (and Project Builder WO) will not launch.  Console says they are looking for App Support framework in System / Private Frameworks.

How do I fix?  Thanks

12/01 Dev Tools is for OS 10.1.  Each major change (10.0 to 10.1 to 10.2) has required a completely new version of Dev Tools. They are neither upward nor downward comaptible. And from what I hear, OS 10.3 (Panther) will be no exception.
