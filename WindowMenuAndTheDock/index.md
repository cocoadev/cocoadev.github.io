From a General/MacOsxDev post by Torrey T. Lyons:

If a Cocoa application does not have a Window menu it will 
give the "Application not responding" message in its pop up menu in 
the Dock. Whether or not the application actually has any windows is 
not important. The Window menu apparently handles the message from 
the Dock.

This was fixed in Tiger.
