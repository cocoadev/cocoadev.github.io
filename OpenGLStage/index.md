This program gives the programmer a general purpose OpenGL viewer. Most of the rendering code in this example is in the DrawingFunctions.h file. The rest of the code just gets the drawing up on the screen. Controls are provided to change the view and light positions. This is a little different than the usual GLUT demo window in that it is structured more like a normal application where OpenGL is used for something functional rather than being just another cheesey demo.
