It is almost impossible to imagine a Cocoa program that does not use C loops.  They are just too useful.  Here are the different kinds.  Wonder what each of them does?

----
The for loop
----
    
for (i = 0; i <= 10; i++)

{

}


----
The while loop
----
    
while (i<=10)

{

}

----
The do while loop
----
    
do

{

}

while ();
