title: OmniFrameworksDocumentationProject

Because there is little in the way of API documentation for the OmniFrameworks, and some of the classes are rather large and opaque (and powerful!), I've undertaken to add as much documentation about the OmniFrameworks as I can to CocoaDev. Please contribute what you know so that the barrier to using these frameworks is lower. They can add a lot to a software project!

Also, please add your name if you've contributed documentation about the OmniFrameworks:

Anyone working on this still? It's still very needed.
