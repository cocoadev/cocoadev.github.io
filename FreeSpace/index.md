FreeSpace is is an open source screen saver engine for Mac OS X Server 1.1. It currently does not work on Mac OS X. 

FreeSpace was written by Mike Trent (MikeTrent) in his spare time. He no longer has any spare time, which is one reason why FreeSpace and the FreeSpace web pages are out of date. Mac OS X also already has a built-in ScreenSaver, which is another reason why FreeSpace is out of date. [ Did I say "another reason"? - MikeTrent ]
