[ Off Topic, my apologies -- MikeTrent ]

ActiveSpamKiller is an OpenSource project on SourceForge that helps you filter spam at the server. It's basically a collection of python scripts that sorts through your incoming mail and intercepts messages that come from an unknown, or known to be evil, source. No more procmail hacking!

The project works well on Mac OS X. It just worked "out of the box" for me, although I did have to muck about with sendmail a little. Maybe someone will write a Cocoa config tool for it ;-)

I have written a little Cocoa app that lets you browse your POP3 INBOX and
delete mails without downloading them. I will release version 1.0 under the GPL.
Perhaps I can integrate ASK somehow, e.g. by integrating the Python interpreter :)
