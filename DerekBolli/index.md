Dedicated fan of all things Apple and Mac for over 20 years

Thanks to this site and reference books like BookCocoaProgramming
and BookCocoaRecipes I am happily porting all my Classic apps to
Cocoa and Objective-C

persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends
on the unreasonable man."
