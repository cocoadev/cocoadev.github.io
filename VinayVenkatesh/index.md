Yeah I've worked on a number of projects including Pic2Icon, MP3 Alarm Clock, Cocoa Sprite Kit (which is still currently being worked on), General/MacAMP, and a bunch more

Really, I've been working on my history major as of late.  But in the recent couple of weeks, I've gone through and finally checked in a LARGE LARGE LARGE code change into the cvs repository for CSK.  I've got scrolling and tiling working.

I'm looking for help on optimizing the code, and documenting it.

**UPDATE**: I've started working at Formac Electronics in San Francisco as such my personal development time has waned.  I'm still putting some effort into Cocoa Sprite Kit though it has been slow as of late.  Other than that, I've got (as always) a number of projects sitting in my sand box.  Drop me an email if you feel like getting touch with me (isn't that obvious).
