The General/ThinkFactory is a set of tools written by General/OneZeroOneNineOneTechnologies (10191 Tech) for developers interested in writing General/ArtificialIntelligence-using software.

Currently, braininabox, a neural network server, has been released, and other servers (fuzzy logic server, et cetera) are under evaluation.

This seems like a really cool concept.  What would be even more interesting would be if one could produce a black-boxed neural net implementation.  ie. I hand it General/NSStrings for the inputs and sample outputs, and it learns the patterns.  Then I just pass it General/NSStrings to parse.  I suppose General/NSData might be more appropriate, but either could work.  Certainly this would be suboptimal and you'd have to rely on sensible defaults to make it work in most cases (and have more advanced tools for those with specific needs), but I think it could open up the amazing potential of fuzzy logic to lots of coders without the expertise to use the neural nets directly. --General/OwenAnderson

Allow me to reveal my ignorance of neural networks... but as somebody who's dipped his toes into AI it seems to me that making neural networks black-boxable, or generic, would lower their efficiency. It seems to me you'd have to throw a metric-shit-ton of strings at em to learn anything. I imagine I just don't know what I'm talking about, though. I also imagine it's a matter of application.

For me, and for my work, I'll just stick to behavioral models - until I have time to do some real studying --General/ShamylZakariya

re-reading my comment above I realize I came off pretty rude... I didn't mean to. Could somebody edify me? I am curious, it's interesting stuff. --General/ShamylZakariya
