Program in Shell Script (BASH, SH), Objective-C 2.0, XHTML, CSS, PBASIC, and BASIC. 
I am currently writing a novel. 
I've got a website at http://thewcubed.com/ and I run a web hosting server if anyone needs a place to store stuff.
I'm currently developing Facile for Facebook, a facebook frontend.


Creating programs that are way too complex and confusing for me.
