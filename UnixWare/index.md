SCO (The Santa Cruz Operation) General/UnixWare.

This company current holds rights to System V and if it has it's way will be turning GNU/Linux into a $700+ per processor licensing nightmare.

Oh, just in case you want to pay for your Linux installations up front [ http://www.sco.com/scosource/linuxqanda.html ]. Sorry to say, but you have missed the promotional deadline of October 31, 2003.
