How, if possible, can I make my service show up in every applications service menu? Any particular SendTypes or what not? I dont want something to have to be higlighted either for it to be enabled. Also can I tell what application asked for the service?

I seem to remember hearing that Carbon applications can't use Services... It would make sense if that were the case.

Yea some carbon applications can not....so what I mean is all other applications :)

Do not define the NSSendTypes and the service will show on every app, but you will not get anything from the Pasteboard... -- NirSoffer
