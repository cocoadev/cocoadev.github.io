Does anyone know if there is a library function for bin packing? I have read that "order and fill" produces reasonable results. Any advice would be appreciated. --zootbobbalu 

----Isn't that NP-complete? (I don't know a function, sorry.)

Actually it is NP-hard.

1DBPP is the search word for this problem (One-Dimensional Bin Packing Problem). Since I found this definition I have found many papers and discussions on the topic. I'll summarize what I find if I find anything useful. --zootbobbalu

Ah, I was thinking of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_packing it turns out.
