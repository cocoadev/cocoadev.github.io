Can anyone offer an example of using Carbon General/APIs from Java on X via General/JDirect? Apple doesn't seem to have any samples, and I can't figure out what libraries I need to include in my project to get any of the Carbon types to resolve.

Seems like everything I try with X requires me to spend hours researching hopelessly inadequate docs and then asking for help!
