---

The NObjective bridge provides the necessary tools to develop and run .NET applications (written in C#, VB.NET, etc.) that interact with Objective-C frameworks and libraries under Mac OS X. 


* High-performance solution with smallest cpu/memory overheads compared to similar bridges
* Huge library of automatically generated proxies around objc classes 

  *More than 2300 classes and 23000 methods can be used directly from your .NET code
  *Proxies are generated using objc-introspection assisted by .h files parsing to achieve more natural method signatures
  *Generates essential enums and structs
  *Also proxies can be generated without C header files

* Transparent exception  rethrowing

* from managed to unmanaged world 
* from unmanaged to managed world 

* Easy access to major Mac OS X frameworks and libraries 

* Ability to generate objc proxies for any framework
* Ability to build your own types that can be used inside Cocoa 

* Combines flexibility of managed and power of unmanaged code to achieve highest performance 

* ships with x86/ppc UB library 

* Client applications can be written in any .NET language ( C#, VB.NET, etc ) 
* Works on most popular versions of OS X: 

* MacOS Snow Leopard 10.6 ( x86 ) + Mono 2.6 
* MacOS Leopard 10.5 ( x86/ppc ) + Mono 2.6 
* MacOS Tiger 10.4 ( ppc ) + Mono 2.6 

* Open Source, Free Software
