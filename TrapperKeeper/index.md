Trapper Keeper is a notebook which resides in your menubar and is designed to mimic the **base** appearance/behavior of Spotlight in order to be as familiar to new users as possible.

I currently have TK in beta, since only two people have tested it other than myself and I mostly am curious about workflow issues and whatnot.  Feedback is either going to be so compelling that I'll change something or at the very least end up in the help section.

*First, it's inappropriate to create an individual page for your applications unless they're open source. If your code doesn't benefit other Cocoa developers, why do we care about your product? Create a personal page for yourself ... feel free to mention (and link to) your products on that page.
*Second, there are other pages on this wiki already which are for shareware topics, and the answers to your other questions are found on Google (and Apple's downloads submission page).
*Third, why on earth would anyone pay any money for beta software? If it's beta, it's not whole and / or unstable. Ridiculous.
*Fourth, **Trapper Keeper is a trademarked name belonging to Mead**: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapper_Keeper ... you're in violation of trademark law and are likely to get your a$$ handed to you in a lawsuit. You ought to know better ... if you don't, hire a lawyer.

My software is feature-complete and completely stable in my experience.  It just felt appropriate to have a one-month period during which I would gather people's opinions of the program and possibly fix a few bugs I hadn't seen yet.  It will be shareware but I couldn't make it freeware now for the beta, that would be lying.

Anyway, thanks for the feedback and I do appreciate all input irrespective of it's bent.

As to the Trapper Keeper trademark thing, of course you're free to disregard that advice ... it'll be interesting to see if Mead (large a company as it is) is interested in someone abusing their trademark. Most companies certainly are.

One more suggestion - you should put some sort of identifying information on your site. Not many people are willing to pay for anything when they can't at least find contact information on the web site.

----
Thanks, I am going to move my questions over to General/SharewareTips and create General/AppSubmissionGuidelines for the (consensus?) opinion that one shouldn't make a page for commercial apps.  I didn't realize I was going against the grain by putting this up.

Thanks for the suggestion about the contact info - that didn't even occur to me in my effort to keep the page clean and minimal.  I'll add that tonight!

Oh and as to the trademark issue - I spoke with a lawyer and he told me I could make a "Cadillac wristwatch" or a "Kodak soda" and that would be fine because they are in different product spheres.  I did consider it but Trapper Keeper is such a fun name and so descriptive, of course I'd rather not be sued and no I'm not oblivious, but we'll see how it goes!

Right, you can make a different product with the same name and it's not a problem as long as they aren't in the same domain. The purpose of trademark is to allow purchasers to be sure about what they're buying. In other words, if I go to the store and buy Coca-Cola, I know that it's from the big Atlanta company and not some knockoff. If I buy some Coca-Cola laundry detergent, there's little chance for confusion, because I know that the big Atlanta company doesn't make that. If I buy some Coca-Cola candy bars (I know, disgusting, just bear with me) then there's still the potential for confusion even though the big Atlanta company doesn't make that either, because it's close enough to what they do make that I can't be sure they haven't come out with a candy bar in the mean time.

The big question is whether a court will find that an app that stores information is close enough to a physical binder which stores information. Unfortunately there's no way to know for 100% sure until you get sued and you either win or lose, although speaking to a good lawyer will get you close. I would personally shy away from it. Your use of the name is intentional and meant to capitalize on a purchaser's knowledge of Mead's product, and as such strikes me as inherently confusing. I would personally avoid it. In any case this is certainly up to you and even if it is technically infringing I imagine you're too small to be noticed. I just wanted to lay out what I know. And of course, I am not a lawyer, trust your lawyer over me.

What interest is this to OSX developers?

It isn't a development tool and doesn't seem to be open source.

----
Actually, I use it all the time as a developer.  I keep lots of code in it and certainly I use it as a pasteboard history.

*"Right, you can make a different product with the same name and it's not a problem as long as they aren't in the same domain."*

I wouldn't say this is incorrect, just incomplete. You can use another company's trademarked name for a separate product **as long as it doesn't cause confusion of the two**. A software application that is meant to organize random bits of information (like Mead's product does), named after that product for the purposes of suggesting your own application does what Mead's product does is **most definitely** grounds for lawsuit. I'd argue that it'd be a difficult one to defend, too. How do you think it'd turn out if Mead argued they were considering creating an electronic product that does what its General/TrapperKeeper product does? Your software product does what Mead's physical product does and uses their registered trademark to imply its function. It'd be easy for Joe Consumer to assume your product was created and/or sanctioned by Meade. Who do you think the law would side with? 

Now if you'll excuse me, the South Park General/TrapperKeeper episode (used as a parody, not a product) is now running through my head and making me giggle a little.

Ha! According to the wikipedia article referenced above, Celph Titled raps "We keep heist plans in a Trapper Keeper. That�s organized crime.�

I guess that just like everything you could actually end up in court over it, yes.  But I did talk it over with someone and I don't think that anyone will think this is a Mead product.  Anyway, I'm kind of disappointed this has become such a sour point.  I was hoping for discussion of the app itself.  Suggestions, ideas. The usual.

Regarding the Mead product confusion, wishful thinking on your part. Consider what it would cost you (in time as well as money) to defend yourself regardless of the outcome.

Regarding the app itself, it looks promising from the screenshot (if it works as advertised). As a beta product you're charging for however, I'm not going to bother downloading and trying it since I know I'm not going to buy it (and I'm not a software pirate). That's my personal preference and a very important comment about your software in general you would find useful (if you heededit). Lots of people do feel that way, even if lots of others don't. Upon further reflection, I suppose you could be saying "pay less for it now as beta and you won't have to pay full price for 1.0" ... which is fine, I guess, but there's still no guarantee 1.0 will be worth 'less than full price' regardless. :-) Not too many people would take such a risk on an unproven and incomplete application. That's my argument. Perhaps my "ridiculous" comment above was over the top, but there you have it. Get it right and name the price ... and I'll try it.

In my experience (as probably TK's only constant user) it has no bugs.  I could have just called it v1.0.  I could call it v2.0 if I wanted.  But I am trying to present an honest picture of the app to potential users like you, and I want to see if I get any complaints during the course of my 3-week beta.  I guess I will have to wait till february 1st to get your download then, which is a shame because I could use hostile testers ;) more than anyone else!

As to the charging specifically, I'm not sure how I could do otherwise.  I can't tell people it's freeware when it's not, and the app is fully functional (limited to 50 entries) even without a license.  So you could download it now and play with it and love it or hate it, no cost, but the fact that I decided to put the word beta after the name makes you shy away.  Honestly that didn't really occur to me, though I do understand where you're coming from.  

What would you do?  Have no beta?  Have a private beta?  Release it "for free" during beta phase?  It's not like I really expect many people to buy it during the beta, (though I have had a few! yay!) but rather that I want to be straight with the public.  I just felt this was the most responsible course of action, and I guess I am almost certainly not getting the maximum number of downloads right now.  Maybe when I put the final version 1.0 out there people will be more at-ease with the name.

----
IMO there's nothing really wrong with charging for a beta. What's wrong is releasing and charging for a 1.0 that's so buggy it should have been a beta. But as for what you should do, standard procedure is generally to recruit some testers, distribute the betas to them for dedicated testing, then when it's solid release it as a 1.0 and give your testers free licenses for their trouble.
