XCode has brought many great features, but some features can get in the way. If you want to speed up the time it takes for a new project to index, read the link below!! --zootbobbalu

Sadly that file seems to be missing on my system:
    
[5:46][~]> ls -al /Developer/Extras/
total 0
drwxrwxr-x   3 root  admin  102 17 Oct 15:09 .
drwxrwxr-x  13 root  admin  442  5 Nov 01:39 ..
drwxrwxr-x   4 root  admin  136 17 Oct 15:09 Palettes

Maybe it comes with Xcode 1.1? installing ATM...

*later...* ahh... now I see the file! :)

It seems strange that such a potentially useful feature is disabled by default. Hopefully Apple can automate this type of setup in the next Xcode Tools release.
