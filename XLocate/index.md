General/JeremyK's first Cocoa application! create a long time ago for 10.1 I think, no longer functions completely. 

Better locate General/GUIs are now available anyway, so it remains in storage as a code reference

**Hey, I made a locate shell too, back in the day. I don't think it worked on anybody's computer but mine, though.**
