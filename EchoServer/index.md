Describe EchoServer here.

----

Presumably an echo server is a server that listens for traffic on a port and just spits it back out again. Unixy operating systems like Mac OS X include "inetd", a daemon which includes a built-in echo server, built-in daytime server, and other goodies that are disabled on security-concious systems.
