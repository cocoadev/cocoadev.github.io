Hey all,
         I've been getting back into OpenGL in cocoa again . I'm trying to find some tutorials/source code for importing 3D OpenGL compatible models.
 
     I've been experimenting with MD2, and I have successfully loaded the MD2 information in my program, though rendering the model is another story :/
 
     I would be really appreciative if anyone could give me some links

NeHe has a .obj loading tutorial, I *think*. -- RobRix

Katherine Tattersall created some tutorials at http://divide.zerobyzero.ca/ -- JimCath

Thank you, I wasn't aware of that page! -- RobRix
