SpellCatcherX uses this to allow the user to add items to its Services/Modify Selection menu, and to configure which Modify Selection services should actually *appear* in the menu (on-the-fly).

PerlPad uses this to allow simple Perl snippets that manipulate text to be turned into items in the menu.

Isn't there something (an UnsanityHaxie, perhaps) that lets you modify your services menu so it doesn't have a bajillion services? 'Twould be nice... I never use the services menu because there's too much junk in it.

Try Service Scrubber (http://www.manytricks.com/servicescrubber/).

IceCoffee [http://web.sabi.net/nriley/software/] adds a Services submenu to the contextual menu, and you can exclude services from that.
