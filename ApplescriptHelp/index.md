I have a problem implementing applescript to which I haven't been able to find an answer.  I've defined some enumerators that are also the names of properties of an object.  Applescript, however, throws an error when the enumerator is used.  The only exception is the use of the "name" enumerator.  It gets handled perfectly.  The enumerators and properties share the same codes and I checked for most of the other obvious errors (or at least what I thought was obvious to me).  Any ideas?
