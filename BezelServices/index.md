Does anyone know how to make use of the BezelServices framework?  It is a private framework, and I assume it is the one that provides OS X with the ability to display feedback images for changes in volume, display brightness, etc (the images are located in /System/Library/CoreServices/BezelUI/Images/).  I would like to provide this functionality for one of my applications.  Any ideas or feedback would be appreciated.

Update 23th October, 2005
On the new iMac there is new methods in this framework for
checking wheter your mac is capable of being used with a IR remote.
I guess this functionality will be included in the next Mac OS X update,
10.4.3 ??

If you want to create bezels - try Growl ( http://www.growl.info ) - it has a bezel display.   You can also embed it in your app (so that if people don't have growl it will offer to install it for them.)
