title: HowToReadHeaderFilesFromProjectBuilderIntoInterfaceBuilder

You need to be in Interface Builder to do this.  Go to the MainMenu.nib window, select the "Classes" tab and select the name of the class you would like to import into Interface Builder.  Go to the menu "Classes" and choose the menu item "Read MyClass.h" where MyClass is the name of your class.  That is it.

You can also drag the header file from ProjectBuilder or the Finder and drop it in your nib file's object window. I find that to be a lot faster than navigating the Classes pane in Interface Builder.
