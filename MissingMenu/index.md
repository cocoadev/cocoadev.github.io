title: MissingMenu

I am building on another application. When running within xcode, the program shows all the symptoms of improperly changing the exectutable name - no main menu, no icon etc. I have not changed the name, and have also checked that all the feilds are correct (based on a discussion about how to properly change the name). Moreover, the program runs normally outside of xcode. This is going to be frustrating to debug if I can't have a menu in the debugger... Any ideas?
