The Custom General/NSView created by Apple for Safari's Tab implementation.

*Is it possible to find the source for this class?*

----

No, just like you can't get the source for any other Cocoa classes.  --K

----

You can try code-dump. http://code-dump.sourceforge.net/ it won't give you usable code. But you can figure out the implementation.

----

You'll have to make your own, or see http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?General/SafarisTabBarView
