What's new at General/CocoaDev?

**May 6, 2008** - Please read this possible plan for General/CocoaDev and send feedback if you like: http://stevenf.com/archive/cocoadev-refresh.php (Sorry, I haven't had much time to work on the site refresh.  I haven't forgotten about it.  It's still on my to-do list.)

**January 9, 2008** - Added a new Forums link that is a better option for free-form discussion threads and Q&A.  Please begin to migrate active discussions to the forums, and reserve the wiki for "encyclopedic" content.  The "Search General/CocoaDev with Google" form on the home page should cover BOTH the wiki and the forums, once Google notices the new section.  Also, did another round of slight cosmetic changes. -- General/StevenFrank

**January 7, 2008** - It looks better in Helvetica.  Trust me!  -- General/StevenFrank (General/StevenFrank, you also didn't list the fact that viewport settings were also added for the iPhone -- didn't like being the "bad" example in Apple's videos, huh? ;D -- General/EmanueleVulcano)

**May 29, 2007** - General/CocoaDev has been moved to a new Xserve to help improve performance. -- General/StevenFrank

** May 20, 2007** - The General/CocoaLocalizers page has been added as a community resource for volunteer localizers. -- General/JoelLevin

**January 6, 2007** - The General/ObjectLibrary was too big to be edited, so I�ve started splitting it into categories. See General/ObjectLibraryRefactoring. -- General/JensAyton

**November 21, 2006** - I've added another new anti-spam measure.  Please let me know if you have any trouble saving legitimate pages as a result.  -- General/StevenFrank

**November 8, 2006** - I've replaced the somewhat out-of-control General/JobOffer page with a real honest-to-goodness job board.  There's also a link to it in the navigation bar.  I think this will be beneficial both to recruiters and prospective candidates alike.  Don't forget to subscribe to the RSS feed, if you're looking for a job!  To hopefully get things rolling, for the first two weeks, employers can post a listing for only $50 using the coupon code GRANDOPENING  -- General/StevenFrank  (please email me if you have any comments or concerns about this)

**October 24, 2006** - There's a new, improved Google search box on the General/FindPage that searches other Cocoa development sites in addition to General/CocoaDev. -- General/StevenFrank

**May 22, 2006** - Cosmetic changes to the     \\%\\%REPLY\\%\\% tag are now live. -- General/KritTer
