I'm a 29 year old free time developer. I mainly focus on more or less useful screen savers. You can visit my homepage to learn more: http://www.wurst-wasser.net/
At day time a work for a big german publishing company - taking care for 500+ Macs (and their users, most female :)), 6 Suns, and a bunch of Mac OS 9/X and Linux based servers.

You may contact me by sending me an email to info at wurst-wasser.net - I recommend to put "Aurelie" in the subject line to pass my spam filter easily.
