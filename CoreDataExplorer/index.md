Core Data Explorer, which is part of FScript, provides interactive access to the new Core Data layer in Mac OS X 10.4. 

Core Data Explorer allows to:

* Explore whole managed objects graphs with a powerful graphical object browser.
* Delve into collections of managed objects with a graphical collection inspector.
* Enter and evaluate Core Data queries interactively.
* Manipulate managed objects with the OOPALProgrammingModel.


Core Data Explorer is open source. More about it at http://www.fscript.org

Great tool! Combined with FScriptAnywhere I can use it to directly query and modify my Core Data persistent stores. Sweet!
