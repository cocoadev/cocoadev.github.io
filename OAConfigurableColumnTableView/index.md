OAConfigurableColumnTableView is a subclass of NSTableView that supports adding and removing table columns via a contextual menu and programmatically. 

PROS: Very nice API. 

CONS: It appears to require that you know all the tablecolumns you might want in advance. It doesn't seem to support adding new columns dynamically.

If I'm wrong, please correct me!
