title: ArrowKeyEquivOnButtonWithInterfaceBuilder
---



I have searched around through the docs, google, here, etc..  But, I can't find how to set an Arrow Key as the Key Equiv for an NSButton in Interface Builder.

I found several responses telling how to do it for a menu item (double click the menu item, rather than using the IB Attributes window).    But, I didn't find any way to do it for an NSButton.

Can anyone enlighten me on this bit of Cocoa wizardry?
