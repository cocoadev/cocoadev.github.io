title: ATSUIWrapper
---

I've always found cocoa text-rendering slow, especially when using NSLayoutManager, so I started an open source (MIT) wrapper for the carbon ATSUI.

Its in C++.  I have made an objective-c wrapper, but its alot slower (comparitivly, it still flies past NSLayoutManager).

You can find a copy of the initial release here:

and a small post describing the functionality here:

As I have only been in ATSUI for the past 3 days, the wrapper is nowhere near complete, so if anyone wants to give a hand just email me (matt@aquaticfire.com)
