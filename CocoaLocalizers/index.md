title: CocoaLocalizers
---

I think it would be a very useful community resource to be able to find a list of localizers who are willing to translate in exchange for a license or whatever else.  If you would like to help start this list, add your name and a way to contact you (and maybe what other languages you speak). Hopefully this list will help out us small Cocoa devs who don't know where to find localizers!
