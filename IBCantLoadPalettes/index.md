I know this isn't exactly a Cocoa question, but...

Whenever I try to install a custom palette in IB, it says "Unable to load palette <palette name>". This happens with every palette I try to install. I am installing palettes by going into the preferences, clicking the Palettes tab, and clicking Add.
Does anyone know what's going on? 

Thanks.
