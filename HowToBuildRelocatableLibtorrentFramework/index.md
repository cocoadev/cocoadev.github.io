title: HowToBuildRelocatableLibtorrentFramework
---

Has anyone managed to build a relocatable boost/libtorrent framework for Mac OS X?

Looking at the library docs, this seems somewhat trivial, if tedious. Putting boost into a framework and then linking your new libtorrentobjc framework to it seems the obvious route. There is already a build option for boost, which makes a framework (in addition to the standard unix libs).

While I am personally interested in this project, please pardon my cynisism when I say this seems like a blatant adverisement for a non-Cocoa (albeit cool) technology. Maybe a deleteme + a more appropriate page for bittorrent related libs in general is in order? --JeremyJurksztowicz
