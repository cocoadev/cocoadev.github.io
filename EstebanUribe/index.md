After a few year hiatus from coding, I'm back into the Cocoa world that I love + looking to create beautiful in form and function iOS and Mac applications.  Have several interests most notably in Mathematics, Science (Physics), and Computers.  

Brushing up on the latest Cocoa development techniques for Mac/iOS and learning ruby but also have experience with C,  Java, C++, Objective C and also done work with Mac OS Toolbox, Carbon, and Cocoa.

Worked with VBA (for Access database design and creation), some .NET and ASP in the past, PHP, Perl, HTML.  

Expanding my interests into just about every computer science area I can (security, encryption, compression, internet applications, etc.)  Have a few projects that haven't been released, and working on two iOS ideas for iPhone/iPad.

Here's my poorly updated web page: http://homepage.mac.com/estebanuribe

Working on an update to the one app I did release and looking forward to putting it up on the Mac App Store in a few weeks.  In the meantime, you're welcome to check out the previous release that's a few years old and frankly I'm ashamed of from a UI standpoint and some never fixed bugs.
