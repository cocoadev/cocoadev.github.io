Greg Miller is a Mac OS X software engineer at Google.  His background is in Unix systems programming, but with the introduction of OS X, he was lured over to the Macintosh.  As time permits he tries to keep a relatively interesting blog about cool Unix/Mac tips, hints, and hacks over at http://unixjunkie.blogspot.com/
