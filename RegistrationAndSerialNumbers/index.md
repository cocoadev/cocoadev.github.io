I've just finished writing my first OS X application, and I need some help--

It's a shareware app, and I need to include registration functionality. I've been looking for some tutorials on how to accomplish this, but I haven't been able to find any that give me enough detail.

Any help would be appreciated. -- GarrettMurray
