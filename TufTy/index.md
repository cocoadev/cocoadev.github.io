Tufty, AKA Simon Stapleton


One-time professional juggler and tightrope walker (really!), professional coding dude, business analyst, foodie, borderline alcoholic, powerkite nut, biker and all round speedfreak.

Current projects : 

General/MacGPG - I'm working on and off on stuff for this project - I slapped together General/GPGDropThing to allow drag and drop encryption and decryption, and I'm mainly working on a Cocoa key management tool at the moment.  Plus, when I get time, a bit of document localisation, but I don't seem to have enough hours in the day for that at the moment.

XOM (eXtensible Object Modeller) - Pure Cocoa, plugin based modeller for pretty much anything that can be modelled with boxes and lines - Entity-Relationship diagrams, Object Models, Physical database models, etc.  Will support code generation at least and round-trip engineering at best.  Obj-C plugin being worked on, will autogenerate classes for certain useful patterns (singleton etc) and make your accessors and mutators with no fuss.  w00t!

Openkite - Pure Cocoa front end for (mainly power) kite design - part of the Openkite project (see http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/openkite if you're really interested)

Openkite-Layout - C++ code to layout arbitrary non-convex polygons on arbitrary sheets.

Bugging Apple to provide more cool tech for us to play with - Objective-C EOF, the Perl-Cocoa bridge they allegedly have kicking around, you know the sort of thing.

Of course, time available for the above is limited by the fact I've just got a nice shiny General/TiBook and so I'm spending most of my time watching General/DVDs or playing Quake.  Or doing paid work (C++/Solaris at the moment)...

...or not.  Moved to the French Alps March 2002, no paid work in computing at the moment, doing up my house http://www.tufty.co.uk/Move/index.html and if anyone fancies giving me Cocoa work in the Alps I'd be happy ;-) as well as working as a house painter and hacking on General/ObjC EOF http://www.tufty.co.uk/Software/General/EOPage.html in my spare time
