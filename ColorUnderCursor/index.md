Having looked at Pixie and after a friend asking if a certain app was possible, I was wondering how people assume Pixie gets the color under the cursor or if there is a more efficient way of getting the color.

Well, I'm a tad busy at the moment, but checking it out with class-dump and otool might show up something interesting. -- RobRix
