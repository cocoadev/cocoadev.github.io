title: QuickTimeMovieDecompression

Ahhrg,

I am searching already for a long time to find some information about the process QuickTime is handling the decoding process of a movie. I know it will determine the right data and media handlers for reading the data out of the file. But what is happening then? I guess the Image Decompression/Compression manager is handling that and is trying to decode the file with the available codecs. But what is the algorithm from QT to find the right codec and if there are many codecs for the same data type (i.e. mpeg-2 or 4 video), which codec is choosen and why? And most important is there a way to influence this process or to set the used codec component later on?
I can't find anything about that and the QT documentation structure is very bad concerning this...
So, please help and write something :)

Greetings,
