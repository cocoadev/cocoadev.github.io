QetiPadgu writes Cocoa software. ...
He has been "programming" for a while, starting with hypertalk. It's funny when you don't have proper instruction and made all your stacks from background fields instead of variables...

The (boring) software he writes is usually at http://qetipadgu.org/software but he spends a lot more time writing software than he does on maintaining that page, which isn't very much either way...
