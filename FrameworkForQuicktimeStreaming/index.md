title: FrameworkForQuicktimeStreaming
---



Is there a framework for quicktime streaming (ie encoding live quicktime video and audio for delivery via darwin streaming server) such as one would use to build apps similar to quicktime broadcaster?  I see a couple of apps on the market that have this functionality so it leads me to believe Apple snuck this API out there and didn't tell anyone.  eg: wirecast
