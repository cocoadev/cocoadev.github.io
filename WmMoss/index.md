General/WmMoss is into programming Cocoa.


I used to write articles for General/CocoaDevCentral such as
***Advice on Learning C**
http://cocoadevcentral.com/tutorials/printable.php?show=00000010.php
***Learn C with Project Builder**
http://cocoadevcentral.com/tutorials/printable.php?show=00000005.php

Not to bring out any bad blood, let's just say that I am no longer considered to be a part of that group anymore.  I wish Erik and the crew the best of luck with their efforts though. We need as many Cocoa resources as we can get!

I work for a big, boring company and have had no call to use Cocoa in my job yet. (Though I continue to look for the possibility to do so.)
