I'm looking for a primer or a forum as good as CocoaDev for understanding how to build my own USB based hardware, how to write the driver for it, and eventually how to write the CocoaApp that will control the hardware.  The hardware isn't incredibly complex -- in fact, I just want to make calls that turn switches on and off... anybody know of a good place to get started?

Is it hopeless?

[http://www.tutorgig.com/store/PR0970284659] has some books on building custom USB hardware.
