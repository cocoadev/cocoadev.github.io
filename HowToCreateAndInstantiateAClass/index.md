Make sure you are running Project Builder and have your project open.  Double click on the "MainMenu.nib" file to open up Interface Builder.  In Interface Builder, go to the "MainMenu.nib" window and click on the "Classes" pane.  All classes you create are subclasses of already existing classes.  In this example, I show you how to create a subclass of NSObject, but you can use the same procedure to create subclasses of other classes.  Here it goes.  Highlight the word "NSObject" and hit enter.  This creates a subclass of the class "NSObject" now type in the name of the class you want to create.  Now go to the classes menu and choose "Instantiate MyController", where "MyController" is the name of the class you just created.  That is it.
