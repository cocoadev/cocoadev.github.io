General/WikiRape: Gross misuse of Wiki boards.

Those who abuse the system of Wiki, the nigh-sacred trust placed in, really, all who visit the site, are horrible, bad people- Wiki Rapists, if you will(separated the terms to avoid defining more things). 

This is a site that exists for the good of the community. Those who hurt the site hurt the community- they are cancerous and vile, and should be removed. (:

Posting a topic like this that everyone agrees with may be a form of General/WikiRape in and of itself, and I apologise.  However, it must be known that to do bad things is extraordinarily not-good.  Those malicious bad people will get theirs, mark my words... 

this was inspired by the second General/WikiRape of General/FoundationCollectionsAndInterfaceBuilder.

let's not let a few bad people spoil all our fun, and all the goodness of this site.  maybe database backups'll have to be more often..

perhaps i'll just backup the contents of sections i like independently, maybe that's a good idea too. ^_^

There have been a *lot* of discussions regarding this on the General/PortlandPatternRepository.

We **do** have a line of defense against General/WikiRape now. If you find a raped page, check out the History option at the top of every page (except General/RecentChanges). You can then revert to a previous, pristine copy.

Rescuing the General/RecentChanges page is a little harder, but by no means impossible. Old copies are stored at <pagename><revisionnumber> - RecentChanges5, for example. These numbers do not make a part of General/WordsJammedTogether, so cannot be made into a link, but you can type them into the page address. Higher numbers are more recent. (The lack of a history option on General/RecentChanges is intentional, though maybe misguided.)
