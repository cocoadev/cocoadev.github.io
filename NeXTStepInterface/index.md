title: NeXTStepInterface
---

I was reading a old MacAddict, and I saw a way to change the interface style of an app to the old NeXTStep style, by adding the this line
    <key>NSInterfaceStyle</key>
<string>nextstep</string>

in the Preference file of the app. But it did not work, any help?

As you have discovered, this no longer works (as of circa Public Beta...) -- FinlayDobbie

Besides, all you would do Josha, is piss off your users by changing it every time they launch your app.

Anyone got any pics of this? I'm curious what it was before it was aqua. Was it like the first version of Mac OS X server?
