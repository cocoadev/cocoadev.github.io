title: NozziTakeover
---

The CocoaDev wiki is under JNozzi|new management. As of April, 2012, Steven Frank of Panic, Inc (its founder and, until recently, owner and curator) sought to find it a new home. It's now hosted and maintained by JNozzi|Joshua Nozzi and the flood of spam has been reduced at least to a manageable level. I'd love to see if we can revive this wiki as the go-to "crowd-sourced documentation" site it had been for so long.

As an avid visitor, anonymous contributer, and self-imposed curator since 2002, I'd like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Steven Frank and "KritTer" for creating such a wonderfully useful resource. To me it was instrumental in my Cocoa / Objective-C learning endeavor and I'm sure I'm far from alone there. Thanks, guys - I'm honored to take on the role of curator and host.

== What's Changed? ==

* The site is now powered by the venerable (and well-maintained) [http://mediawiki.org MediaWiki], the same software that powers Wikipedia and many other wiki sites
* Login is now **required** to contribute (to edit and discuss pages)
* The forums and jobs links are now gone so we can focus on what's important - crowd-sourced documentation and tutorials
* Several volunteer moderators (to be introduced later) will help keep things clean
* We have a comically bad new logo for now (I ask the community to do embarrass my 5 minute hack job with a better logo)

== Known Issues ==

* The import into this new wiki has turned many instances of '*' in the code into ' ', thus pointers look weird.
* The custom code tags from the previous wiki don't work, and much of the code has lost it's formatting.

See: WikiChanges for a list of stuff that should/could be changed.


== Original Message from Steven Frank ==

<blockquote>
I currently don't have enough time to maintain CocoaDev properly, and without attentive moderation it is filling up with spam.

I'm talking with some people interested in taking over the site. I would like to see it continue operating under a new owner.

Sorry for the inconvenience. I hope to have this sorted out shortly.
