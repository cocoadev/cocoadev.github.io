I don't mean to imply that I think that this is a measure of productivity or anything, but now that my project is 30 classes and growing, I am feeling really curious as to just how much code have I written in 1000 hours of programming, in terms of sheer volume.  Is there something I'm missing in Xcode, SubEthaEdit, or TextMate?  I can't figure out how to find out this number.  Does anyone know how to find out, or have a quick terminal command I could use maybe?

thanks!
