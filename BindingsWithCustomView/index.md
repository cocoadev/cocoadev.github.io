title: BindingsWithCustomView
---



I have followed various tutorials and now have no problem creating a master/detail interface using bindings to manage an NSMutableArray of objects. I use an NSTableView as the master view to provide selection capabilities so a single object from the array can be displayed in the detail view. So, my question is: how can I replicate the same functionality using a custom view rather than the NSTableView? How can I make my custom view bindings-aware and have it designate a particular object in my array to be the "selected" one?
