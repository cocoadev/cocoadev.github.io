I was wondering if anyone knew of any examples/tutorials of making BEEP applications involving Objective-C or just BEEP examples in general (preferably chat possibly?).  There seems to be a lot of technical information online about BEEP but little to know working examples in C let alone Objective-C.  Also, I know XGrid provides an Apple framework, but I don't know how safe it is to use it.

Thank you,

How about the Linux version of the Xgrid agent... http://www.novajo.ca/xgridagent/ OK it is not Cocoa or Obj C, I know :-) --CharlesParnot
