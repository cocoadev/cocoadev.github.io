**SnoizeMIDI**

http://www.snoize.com/MIDIMonitor/Source/

A framework containing code for dealing with CoreMIDI in a Cocoa app:

*Creating a CoreMIDI client
*Finding MIDI devices, sources, and destinations
*Creating "streams" of input and output data, and hooking them up to inputs and outputs
*Parsing MIDI streams into separate MIDI messages
*Dealing with older versions of CoreMIDI (from 10.1 onwards)

Hello, can someone post an example of how to use this framework and and send out MIDI messages? thanks, E.D.
