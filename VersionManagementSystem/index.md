Hi all,

I have a little question and I think this is the best place to ask. I have old machine running Mac OS 9 and new one with OS X. I want to setup version management system on OS 9 that I could access with OS X. Did anybody tried this? CVS doesn't seems to work with Mac OS 9 (there are clients, but no server?)

Thanks,

Aidas
