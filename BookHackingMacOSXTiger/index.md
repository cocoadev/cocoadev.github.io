Book Description (from Amazon page)

* This serious, down-and-dirty book blows away the default system settings, unlocks hidden gems, and offers readers total control over their Mac OS X system like never before
* With tricks to make the Tiger purr, this book concentrates on optimizing the appearance, speed, usability, and security of Mac OS X systems to squeeze out every ounce of performance
* Heavyweight hackers will learn how to change the Mac OS X boot, welcome, and login screens or even design their own; tweak, customize, or replace the Dock; and customize favorite applications like iDVD, iMovie, and iTunes
* Speed it up, lock it down, or pull back the curtains-readers get the scoop on disabling unneeded devices and creating options to make their computers run faster, tweaking services and hiding user accounts to make their computer more secure, and using the Unix command to unlock hidden settings.


*Using **the** Unix command, eh? Wow. Are the Unices becoming monolithic like Windows?* ;-)

I'm sure it means the Unix command line. But that would be cool. "The Unix command does everything, if you give it the right flags"
