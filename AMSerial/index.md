*Actually called AMSerialPort*

A collection of two classes to access serial ports. Based on the Serial Port Sample from Apple. Use AMSerialPortList to get an array of available serial ports. Get an AMSerialPort from there and access it either through its NSFileHandle or via the methods defined in the AMSerialPortAdditions category.
