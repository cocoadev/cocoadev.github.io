**Discussion:**

Refactored the page to remove the argument and provide a bit of useful information. Could someone who can actually figure out what the heck this company *does* please fill in the *mumble* above to tell us about it?

I found the About page, but dismissed it. It's so general and fluffy that it may as well say, "We look for things. Things to make us go."

It appears that they are one of those companies that is moving programming to India. Basically, they're like a weird contractor: they create software for other companies, but it's all planned out by the higher-up guys. There is no mention of Cocoa on there. Only .Net and other Windows frameworks.

Actually, we are nothing like a 'weird contractor.' We do have a shop in India, and they do software development. However, so do all our offices. We have a very specialized skill set, and we do not hire out developers at market rate to anyone looking for just a developer with a pulse. In fact we recently bowed out of an engagement when the client started treating us that way. We look for large, complicated projects with ambitious deadlines. It's what we do best.

We aid software shops in the development process and delivery cycle. Statistically, business IT shops fair poorly on software projects. around 50% miss deadline and are over budget. Many of the late projects deliver less than what was promised, and the business usually is disappointed in the effort. We strive to teach IT shops new processes and procedures so that targets are hit, budgets are made, businesses get what they ask for, and code quality is improved. Agile development practices are the most common methods of acheiving those goals. We work alongside client staff to augment their skills and introduce new methods and processes.

The web site's target audience is upper management - so what is referred to as 'fluff' above is actually exactly appropriate for the audience. Few in IT upper management care too much about how - just about cost and a successful track record. 

Java and .NET are our primary platforms because they are business's primary platforms. We've also developed code in Ruby, Fort� (a defunct development platform), and a few other proprietary environments. While our developers must have skills marketable to our clients, we've accepted several engagements where the target platform was not an advertised skill.

I do Cocoa - and I do a lot of it. Unfortunately it's all been on my own time. It's a catch 22 situation. TW as a whole isn't interested in pushing a particular technology. Our focus is on development process and practices. Yes, in order to do that our staff must have demonstrated technological skill, and Java and .NET have the most demand by far. Every T<nowiki/>houghtWorker I know who is involved in Cocoa is dreaming of an opportunity to join a Cocoa project and increase its presence in the market. The only way we can do that is to continue to push and promote Cocoa on our own time.

By the way - I really don't like having this explanation here. This is definitely advertising, and not Cocoa related. It's only ancillary to being related to development. But speculation was high and I thought I'd put it to rest.

I appreciate the explanation, advertising or no. It's nice to get an idea of the company in language that doesn't require a frontal lobo^W^Wbusiness degree to understand.

I also think it is fine to have companies on this web site, as long as they are somehow involved in some Cocoa stuff... or have their employess pushing to get the company into Cocoa.
