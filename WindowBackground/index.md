What docs? Sorry i thought i put this on the discussions.

Look at the API documentation for General/NSWindow at http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/General/ApplicationKit/ObjC_classic/Classes/General/NSWindow.html and note the method "setBackgroundColor:".  The API documentation is the best source for figuring out how to do stuff in Cocoa.
