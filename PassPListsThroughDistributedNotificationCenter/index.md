title: PassPListsThroughDistributedNotificationCenter

Anyone know how much stress it would put on system resources if I used the NSDistributedNotificationCenter to pass PLists from one app to another. I know I can use NSConnection/NSProxy combos but using strings to pass PLists is easier and more simple.
