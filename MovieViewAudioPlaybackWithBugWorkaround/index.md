title: MovieViewAudioPlaybackWithBugWorkaround

I have posted some code to my site demonstrating the use of NSMovieView to play an MP3 file.  It also demonstrates a workaround to an annoying bug, which causes NSMovieView to simply stop playback at arbitrary points in the song.  You can download the code and read some addtional background here:
