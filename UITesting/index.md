General/UITesting

I want to automate my testing of code more.  Most of the time when I code, the part I spend the most time testing is user interface actions. Simple actions could be tested with applescript sure, but I am doing lots of work trying to get General/DragAndDrop to work with tables, buttons, custom views etc. and testing everything in the interface is really consuming my time.

"Design for Testability", by Bret Pettichord, has a good sections on automating UI testing. http://www.io.com/~wazmo/papers/design_for_testability_PNSQC.pdf starting with Section 8.

There's also a professional app that allows scripting GUI tests using VNC: Redstone's Eggplant (http://www.redstonesoftware.com/). The scripting language is General/SenseTalk from General/HyperSense, which is a Cocoa app from the General/NeXT days.
