I never worked with views and color before in any application, and I was wondering what a good start would be?
Thanks in advance. : )

Subclass an NSView, look at NSColor and NSBezierPath. :)

*Also the NSRect functions, also... well, there's a thousand and one demos about this stuff out there, browse them until you know not just how they're structured but how they work their magic.*

**Also look at NSImage.**
