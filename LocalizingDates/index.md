I'm not sure how to cleary go about localizing a NSDate object. I want just a simple MM/DD/YYYY string, but have it localized properly. For example, in the UK it would be DD/MM/YYYY. How do I go about doing this? I'm aware of NSCalendarDate's descriptionWithCalendarFormat:locale but am slightly confused on how to localize it properly. Any help would be excellent.
