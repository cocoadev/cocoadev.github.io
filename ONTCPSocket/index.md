---

ONTCPSocket is a class within the OmniNetworking framework that supports the creation and management of TCP client and server sockets.  While  much of the functionality is exposed through the interface of its parent class ONInternetSocket, ONTCPSocket exposes the ability to control certain TCP-specific connection details such as Nagle's algorithm.
