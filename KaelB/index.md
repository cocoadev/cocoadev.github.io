Hi All!  If you are reading this, you must be bored.

I am a Cocoa developer that has some previous experience with Applescript (Cocoa is much better), and some basic HTML, XHTML, and CSS.  I am in the process of creating an awesome Cocoa version of an Applescript application called Slopinator ( see http://www.slopinator.co.nr ) and will hopefully be finished soon.  If you are interested in collaborating on a Cocoa project, feel free to contact me at:
