SimpleSolutions -- **Table of Contents Page**.

If you've spent hours trying to get Cocoa/ObjC to do some "little" thing that, for whatever reason, isn't well documented (or is just plain unintuitive), you aren't the only one. But now that you've got it solved, why not add the solution to the appropriate SimpleSolutions page(s) and spare someone else a little of the aggravation.

**Table of Contents:**

* SimpleSolutionsNSTableView
* SimpleSolutionsNSColor
* SimpleSolutionsNSArrayExcBadAccess

Feel free to add new pages. Please try to stick to the same page format (copy an existing page and modifying it is easier than starting from scratch). After you've created a new page, come back and add its name to the table of contents.
