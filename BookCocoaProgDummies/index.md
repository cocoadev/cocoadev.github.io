----**Comments**----


*Now I've seen everything!  The last thing I ever expected was a book on Cocoa Programming for Dummies.  :)  I don't think you can be a "dummy" and program the Cocoa Framework in Objective C.  It'll be interesting to see if they also throw in Applescript and/or Java too. *[They actually do]* **Aw, c'mon! I own this book. It's on my reference shelf right next to "Advanced Nanoscale Engineering Design Theory For Dummies (TM)"**
*Do we need another book on this level? *Ah, but there ARE no other Cocoa books on this level!*  ;-)
*I think the more books on Cocoa Programming the better!  Look at all of the books available in the Windoze world.  Right now there are more programming books being written for Macintosh programming than there have been for a decade.  In the long run this is good news for all!
*Do we know anything about the author?  A google search turns up "RealBasic for Dummies", but nothing Cocoa-related.  Is this going to be RealBasic for dummies with a find and replace?

* This is a very odd book.  I think it'd be good for folks who can't quite handle the Hillegass book.  This will get them far enough along to where they can use a more advanced book.  There are some "huh?!?" things in the book which defy explanation, but overall a decent For Dummies intro book.  It does cover some apple script and quicktime stuff that other books don't cover, so it has some merit. *Using Cocoa in the same way that you might use RealBasic*

*The book is disjointed, with that chatty Dummies style. Terrible editing, and lots of interruptions for stuff that
someone at this level is not likely to find useful (the File Merge utility for dummies? GMAB!)

OTOH, there a couple of real gems. Like "everything you wanted to know about NSCalendarDate but don't quite have a use for yet...."
*I am a newbie to cocoa. That makes me the "dummy"... but after reading it, i still don't know how to produce anything useful. I say... for anyone who does not know programming, don't read this book because it does not teach any programming concepts. For advanced readers, don't buy this book because you don't get much out of it.
* How about some info about using the MENU!? Why is the "Text" Chapter having you make save buttons, when there is a perfectly good save option in the file menu... If I released an app which used a Button for saving instead of the menu version I'd be the laughing stock of the SandBox.
* In answer to the last comment: I guess First Responder is a concept that Dummies cannot handle. D'oh!
* I got this book after having success with a few other books of the series. It led you step-by-step through projects, but never generalized the information for you. It taught only by example, nothing else.
* I bought this book when I tried learning Cocoa. It was a waste of my money, its in the attic somewhere...
* Most of you are being very harsh on this book. This was my first book on COCOA/XCode and it got me thru the mechanics of creating simple programs in no time. After I was done with this book I was ready to start exploring on my own. The problem with this book is that it has a For Dummies title and, therefore, there is an implicit prejudice about it. In my opinion this is a very nice book for the person who wants to start programming COCOA/XCode. This is a good first book. I give it a BUY IT vote.
