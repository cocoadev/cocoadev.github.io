title: ConcreteSubclass
---



A ConcreteSubclass is a class, generally a SubClass of an AbstractSuperClass, which provides specialized behaviour, possibly with limited scope. Most of the time when you create a controller class or similar class, you are creating a ConcreteSubclass of NSObject, and perhaps other classes, which may or may not be abstract.
