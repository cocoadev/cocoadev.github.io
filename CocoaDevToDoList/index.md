Since CocoaDev is a community site, we could use some direction.

Add any tasks/guidelines you think are needed that don't require modification to how the site works, and use this page to get some ideas on what you can do for the site.

Improvements:

* additional content in the CocoaGlossary is always a good idea.
* make the AppKit and FoundationKit sections more useful by turning the class pages (NSString, NSArray, et cetera) into class references with more and better content than Apple's equivalents. Samples of how to use them are also an excellent idea.
* some new RecentTutorials would be good, perhaps one on assembler (aiming at RobRix here **What the heck do people think *I* know about assembler? All I can do is get myself in trouble with it!**)? Perhaps they meant KritTer? **One can only hope.**
* we need more pages like the one on MemoryManagement. That page is generally informative about a pertinent developer topic, and brings together a lot of information both on and off-site.


Maintenance:

* CocoaDiscussions needs old conversations moved to RetiredDiscussions or refactored to be information pages, as discussions are off-putting for those just looking for information.
* we can always use more CocoaSampleCode and CocoaTutorials and TipsAndTricks, so if you've got something along those lines, by all means share it!
* check new users have \\%\\%BEGINENTRY\\%\\%CocoaDevUsers\\%\\%ENDENTRY\\%\\% on their user pages; similarly for other topics, like CocoaDiscussions and CocoaGlossary

Please add any suggestions below for how you see to improve the site.

My advice on WhenDiscussionsConclude is just to orphan the page. If a question comes up enough to annoy people, we can find a place to put it, but I don't think C**'ocoaAnsweredQuestions would be it. Far better to create a logical system, perhaps attaching the question to the class that provokes it, or the relevant section of the CocoaGlossary. If people don't check there first, they won't scour a less organized system.

Since we have CocoaDiscussions already, no need for a C**'ocoaUnansweredQuestions. -- KritTer

How about a cocoadev specific browser? Not a web browser - we have enough these days. I'm thinking more of a content browser that just happens to get all/most of its data from here. Think Watson or Sherlock - a 'native' interface would be nice, right?

**Got that!**

What possible use would the search feature of this site be if answered questions were deleted? Orphaning and refactoring pages is fine, but deleting them outright is just wrong. I can guarantee that if this happened, you'd see the same questions asked far more than twice.
