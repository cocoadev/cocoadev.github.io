title: TagsNotGettingReplaceInCustomTemplate
---

Hi all,

I'm creating a custom Tempalte project in Xcode 2.0 .  I have declared all the files that have tags that needs to be replaced in the General/TemplateInfo?.plist file inside my .xcode bundle.  All seems well and i can create a new project from my custom template, however i get a few files that haven't had their tags being replaced.
I've checked paths and names of the files not having their tags replaced, but i can't spot the problem at all.. Just wondering if someone has encountered the same situation or know of a solution..

Thanks heaps, John

Okay, that begs the questions: Which files? What are the file types of the problem files? Which tags aren't being replaced? What does your PLIST file look like?
