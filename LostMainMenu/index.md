I'm building on another's application - but it has all the symptoms of having improperly changed the executable name (even though I have not changed it) i.e. no menu, the window is not ordered front, no icon. I have read and followed the directions on how to properly change it, but can see no errors. Moreover, if I run the same built program from finder, it runs normally with no problems. Any ideas?
