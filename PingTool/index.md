PingTool is a Mac OS X Cocoa project that provides an Objective C class for using icmp to ping hosts on the network. It uses NSNotifications to report status, can be configured in a variety of ways and can provide relatively detailed statistics on the host it is pinging.

The header files are documented with headerdocs and sample code is provided.

The code was originally based on Apple sample code.
