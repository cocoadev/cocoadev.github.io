Does anyone know exactly *what* kind of output
    dataWithEPSInsideRect:
produces?
It sure ain't the ordinary kind of eps... looks more like pdf wrapped up in an eps wrapper. This actually makes the save as EPS functionality in AquaTerm a lot less interesting. You e.g. can't run PSfrag on the output from it:-(
