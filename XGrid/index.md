*Imagine waking up one day to find your Mac has solved a vexing scientific problem.*

Xgrid is being developed by Apple to allow mac users to easily put together a cluster of mac for CPU-intensive calculations.

**Technology Preview 2 (TP2)**

At present, Xgrid is available as a "Technology Preview" (a fancy name for a beta version??).
In this version, Xgrid plug-ins can be written using Cocoa and General/XCode.


**Xgrid 1.0**

Announced publicly by Steve Jobs at the WWDC keynote address, and on the apple mailing list:

*

*The "GM" version, Xgrid 1.0, will be part of Tiger and Tiger Server (due first half of 2005)
*We are describing a new Cocoa-based API at WWDC, but it is still under NDA
*We are exploring the possibility of a Tech Preview 3 later this summer

*

This means that one will be able to fully integrate the power of Xgrid in its application, through a new Cocoa framework.
