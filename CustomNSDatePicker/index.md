I have a graphical style NSDatePicker which only displays time, not date (so it's a clock graphic). But I want to change default clock face to my own graphic. I'm assuming I'd have to subclass class it, but is there an easy way to get what I want without having to reimplement the hands and mouse-tracking and stuff?

Thanks.
