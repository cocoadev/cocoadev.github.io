ObjectPascal is an object oriented dialect (extension) of the original Pascal language. Originally developed by Apple, also used by Borland since the early days of DOS TurboPascal. The only Modern (currently shipping) commercial product based on ObjectPascal syntax is Borland Delphi (sold as Borland Developer Studio 2006).
