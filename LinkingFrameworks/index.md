I woud like to create a framework that imitates another framework and links against the old version, in a manner similar to that described in GlobalModifications and WindowShade, but I'm running into all sorts of difficulties - no matter what build settings or flags I use, applications compiled against the old framework can't resolve symbols through my new one which replaces it. I know this used to work in 10.0 and earlier - has something changed since then that makes this impossible?
