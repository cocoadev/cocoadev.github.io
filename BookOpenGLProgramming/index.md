Robert P. Kuehne, in co-operation with J. D. Sullivan, has released a new book, "OpenGL Programming on Mac OS X".

OpenGL� Programming on Mac OS� X will be valuable to Mac programmers seeking to leverage OpenGL's power, OpenGL developers porting their applications to the Mac platform, and cross-platform graphics developers who want to take advantage of the Mac platform's uniquely intuitive style and efficiency.

The Mac has fully embraced OpenGL throughout its visual systems. In fact, Apple's highly efficient, modern OpenGL implementation makes Mac OS X one of today's best platforms for OpenGL development. OpenGL� Programming on Mac OS� X is the first comprehensive resource for every graphics programmer who wants to create, port, or optimize OpenGL applications for this high-volume platform.
Leading OpenGL experts Robert Kuehne and J. D. Sullivan thoroughly explain the Mac's diverse OpenGL APIs, both old and new. They illuminate crucial OpenGL setup, configuration, and performance issues that are unique to the Mac platform. Next, they offer practical, start-to-finish guidance for integrating key Mac-native APIs with OpenGL, and leveraging the full power of the Mac platform in your graphics applications.
Coverage includes
	•	A thorough review of Mac hardware and software architectures and their performance implications
	•	In-depth, expert guidance for accessing OpenGL from each of the Mac's core APIs: CGL, AGL, and Cocoa
	•	Interoperating with other Mac APIs: incorporating video with QuickTime, performing image effects with Core Image, and processing CoreVideo data
	•	Analyzing Mac OpenGL application performance, resolving bottlenecks, and leveraging optimizations only available on the Mac
	•	Detecting, integrating, and using OpenGL extensions
	•	An accompanying Web site (www.macopenglbook.com) contains the book's example code, plus additional OpenGL-related resources.
