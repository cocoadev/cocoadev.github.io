I did lots of perl for several years, before getting into java and now Objective-C. I like Objective-C the best (although I am very interested in learning Smalltalk now), and would like to take on some open-source projects to help build up the General/ObjC/Cocoa community. 

Please don't hold my perl past against me :)

I live in Silicone Valley and work on enterprise business software (woohoo) by day. I'm also a musician and avid reader. 

I love my iBook, so much that my General/GeeFour killed my Studio Display in a fit of jealous rage. I still like the General/GeeFour too, though.

****** General/RobRix holds General/WilliamBajzek's perl past against him

****' General/KritTer likes Perl, it runs General/CocoaDev. But he still holds it up to General/WilliamBajzek to see what happens

****' General/RobRix brandishes a dead trout menacingly*
