Perhaps better than General/NeHe, for one who wants to learn General/OpenGL instead of to learn how to do something in General/OpenGL, is the General/RedBook.  More theory, more abstract, and more, at least, my pace--  after reading the General/RedBook once or twice, I looked at General/NeHe and, at each tutorial lesson, read the objective and then wrote the necessary code, and compared to what the tutorial said was correct.  I suppose my approach was more to learn General/OpenGL as General/OpenGL, and not for a specific purpose, but for those who want to gain deep knowledge of the API, I strongly, strongly suggest the General/RedBook.  It can be found at http://fly.cc.fer.hr/~unreal/theredbook/index.html.

The General/RedBook is more an in-depth look at General/OpenGL than it is a cookbook.
