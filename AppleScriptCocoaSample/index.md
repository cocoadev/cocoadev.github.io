SOAPdish 1.0 is an adaptation of Apple Computer's original Current Temperature by Zipcode AppleScript script converted to a custom AppleScript/Cocoa application.

The complete project source code and compiled binary can be found here http://home.earthlink.net/~zobkiw/

*--It seems the above url no longer works*

For more information on SOAP http://www.xmethods.net is a good jumping-off point. This particular example implements the Weather - Temperature service.
