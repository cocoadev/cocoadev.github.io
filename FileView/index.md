FileView is TomWaters' Finder replacement.  Written in ObjC and Cocoa with a little bit of CF stuff thrown in to be compatible with OS9 Finder notions.

Here is a link to an ongoing discussion about its development.

All links seems to be broken � is the project still alive? and how does it compare to other Finder alternatives?

*As far as I know, it's not been alive for some time now.*

Sorry, FileView ended when whidbeysoft.com burned in a house fire.
