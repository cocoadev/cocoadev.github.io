title: RetiredVsActiveDiscussions

Retired is not Deleted. It just means the discussion is kind of over, the question was answered. But that does not mean content can not be added. In fact, ideally, the page could be linked from other places, and or refactored to be incorporated in a page that makes sense. eg: CamelBones examples from EmbedPerl could be moved to the CamelBones page, and refered to from the satellite. 

And then, the retired discussion becomes a reference while community members confer in active spots.  Thus we combat the Second law of thermodynamics http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics .
