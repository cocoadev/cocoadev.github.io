See also SocketClasses.

CoreFoundation 's Networking classes built on top of the RunLoop. 


*CFSocket
*CFStream
*CFHost


----
You may see CFNetwork appear in webserver logs or website statistics applications from programs using these classes.

We have a socket class now available on the code section of our website that simplifies asynchronous networking using CFSocket. NetSocket should fit well into any networked application that has a runloop.

I have also written a socket class, AsyncSocket, that probably fills the same niche as NetSocket. -- DustinVoss
