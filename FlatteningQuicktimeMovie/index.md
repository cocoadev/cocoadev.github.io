I'm trying to save a QuickTime movie from a document-based cocoa application in a flattened format. So far all I've managed is to save it with references to the original movie data. Do I need to do low-level handling of the file in the writeToFile method?

Apple has posted some sample code for flattening a movie using QTKit: http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/QTKitCreateMovie/listing9.html
