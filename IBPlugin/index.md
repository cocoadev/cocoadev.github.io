Hi,

Has anyone worked on IBPlugin?

*Yes.*

*I think what this poster meant to say (and I second it) is "Is anyone able to put in some basic info about creating your own IBPlugin here, maybe a mini-tutorial of sorts?"*

*If you have specific questions, please ask on the forums. --JediKnil*

I've just recently built a very simple plugin with custom bindings and I used this documentation to start:
