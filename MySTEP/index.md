Oh? How nice.

This could be interesting. 
1. How much of the code-base is derived from GNUStep? 
2. How complete is it and when will it be available? 
3. Also, will there be any way to cross-compile for the platform?  (I don't have a Zaurus but that and Palm OS 6 are the only things that interest me in the PDA space in the near future)

1. approx. 90%. 
2. completion of Foundation: 95% AppKit: 70%. Available: alpha/beta reelases: now.
3. There is a Cross-Compiler for the Linux-ARM architecture that plugs into Xcode and makes porting of applications very straight-forward. http://www.dsitri.de/wiki.php?page=Zaurus-X-gcc
