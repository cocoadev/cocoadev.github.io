title: CFBundleSignature

Does this actually serve a purpose? I think this is what would be the creator code under Carbon, but does LaunchServices prefer the CFBundleIdentifier for its various caching purposes?

*From a small test it seems that Finder only shows my application under "Open With..." when my application has a signature. That's a shame, because bundle identifiers are much easier to manage, and the chance of a clash is minimal...*
