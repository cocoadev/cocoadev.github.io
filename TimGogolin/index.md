Tim Gogolin


I've been programming Macs and Windows professionally for 10 years (and a few years earlier as a hobby). I've been doing C++ for as long as I can remember, but I'm really enjoying some General/ObjectiveCee toy projects I've been playing with at home. Even though I've been using C++ forever, I basically "get it" when it comes to the advantages of a more dynamic runtime.

I have a little word search game (in Cocoa, of course) that I'd like to make available when I get the time to polish it a little more.
