Hello folks,
I'm a newbie on that internet/networking stuff...
I'm trying to do audio content streaming over internet (like MP3 Sushi, etc.) but I don't have any idea of how to do that type of thing ...
Any sugestions ?

Have you looked at QuickTime Streaming Server? (http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/qtss/) It does things like MP3 and MP4 streaming over the Internet. It's bundled with Mac OS X Server. The open source version, Darwin Streaming Server (http://developer.apple.com/darwin/projects/streaming/) is available, and I'm not completely sure, but I think it's free. I can't seem to find any information about buying it, anyway.

There's also QuickTime Broadcaster for live encoding and streaming.
