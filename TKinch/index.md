I am the author of Avenir (http://returnself.com/), The Writer's Workshop.

Parts of the source are available (http://returnself.com/code.php ) along with a little info on how to use it.

So far I have released:

* a keyboard navigable subclass of General/NSTableView.  Sorry, it only works if you are using General/CocoaBindings.

* a subclass of General/NSArrayController that allows searching via a one-method protocol in your model object and filtering on up to four criteria.

Both are dual-licensed: choose BSD or GPL depending on what sort of project you want to use it in.

I also blog about Cocoa from time to time at http://returnself.com/blog/

I recently put up an article (http://returnself.com/blog/2005/03/09/beyond-bindings-cool-stuff-about-key-value-coding/)about uses for KVC and KVO outside of bindings.
