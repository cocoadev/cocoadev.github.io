Is there anything like java's JDBC or perls DBI for Cocoa?  It would be nice to have a common database API to program to.

OK, I'll bite.  Yes, there is.  Well, there was.  EnterpriseObjectsFramework is what you are looking for.  It beats everything else hands down, and, believe me, I've done some database programming in my time.
