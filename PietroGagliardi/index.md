I have worked with Windows for a couple of years and this is my first time programming for Mac. I originally wanted to learn Carbon because it was for C, but I then found out that Carbon had something that had to do with Mac OS 9. I then went to Cocoa for Java but found some roadblocks along the way. Now I'm here with Cocoa for Objective-C, ready to try out some radical ideas (with some help, of course).

What I know already: Programming Languages: C, C++, Java, Pascal, Liberty BASIC/Just BASIC, DarkBASIC, Blitz Basic, a little bit of Microsoft QuickBASIC/QBASIC, Forth, a little bit of COBOL and Fortran. GUI toolkits: A little bit of Qt, a little bit of Windows API, Java Swing, Just BASIC/Liberty BASIC's internal GUI commands .
What I want to learn: Cocoa, Quartz, WebKit, Objective-C .
What I know already: The bare-bone basics of Cocoa, enough Objective-C to start off, a tiny bit of WebKit, only one or two things about Quartz :-)
Projects I want to do: For my company: Image editor, web designer, maybe a vector graphics editor - to make Adobe blush. For opensource: I really do not know.
