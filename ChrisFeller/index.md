I'm an ex-Microsoftie who finally got fed-up one day, quit his job, installed FreeBSD at home, and never looked back.  Soon after, I started playing around with OS X and came to appreciate the design of the operating system and the hardware it runs on.  I'm seeking to regain some of my lost karma by doing OS X development, but I'm still a little hesitant to give up my C++ and STL.
