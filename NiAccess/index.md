NiAccess used to be the framework for manipulating NetInfo from Cocoa applications (it's what NetInfoManager uses), but it has been deprecated and is going away.

The API that Apple wants you to use for the same functionality is found in the DirectoryService framework, but it is a C API. I made a start at a DirectoryKit Obj-C wrapper, but never got very far.
