Python [http://www.python.org] is a popular ScriptingLanguage in the UNIX community and beyond. Python is object-oriented ["multi-paradigm" is the preferred classification] and easy to extend with libraries written in C, which makes it possible to write really fast programs, really fast.

Other commonly cited strengths are:


* Clean syntax -- it uses newlines, rather than semicolons, to separate statements, and indentation, rather than curly braces, to mark code blocks.
* A comprehensive standard library ("batteries included"), and a wide variety of third-party libraries and frameworks
* Excellent code readability (fostered by the idea that in most cases there should be Only One Way To Do It)


The current version of Python is 2.5; OS X 10.4 ships with Python 2.4.

You can use Python + PyObjC to create Cocoa applications! It's not perfect and YMMV but you can find the bridge here: [http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/]

py2app [http://undefined.org/python/#py2app] converts Python scripts into Mac OS X applications.

There's a very good introductory tutorial by Jonathan Rentzsch on Apple's developer site: [http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/pyobjc.html]

appscript [http://appscript.sourceforge.net] allows Python to control scriptable applications in place of AppleScript.
