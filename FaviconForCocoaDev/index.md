title: FaviconForCocoaDev

There should be a favicon for CocoaDev so it's easier to find among bookmarks, which I am sure all of us have lots of. I whipped up a quick suggestion as a starting point: http://kovs.shacknet.nu/~markus/cocoadev-favicon.png

Sounds like a good idea

--TomLynch

Yes, I dig it as well.

--MatthiasGansrigler

Very nice. -- RobRix

----

I like this idea too, although maybe the 'D' should be lowercase. -- KaelB

----

Why lowercase? It's capitalized in the titlebar, not to mention the whole CamelCase thing. -- RobRix

----

Thanks for doing this!  I've installed it.  -- StevenFrank

----

Rejoice! It looks so lovely (: -- RobRix

----

You're right, it does look better uppercase.  -- KaelB
