Hi, my name is Thomas Sempf.  I am studying multimedia computing in Germany, Osnabrueck.

At the moment I am busy with writing a Video Annotation System for my diploma thesis.

I have a preview release of the General/IconaraDOM framework that has been tested by another cocoa developer for some weeks. It seems stable enough. I have included some of the features you were requesting (copying and better General/XPath support). You can download the release at http://developer.iconara.net/products/DOM/index.html. Nice API documentation is comming (currently the documentation only exist in the header files).

Copying is done with -copy, which is implemented for every node type. You may experience problems with copy, I hav to test it as thouroughly as I can, but tests are not always complete, it needs to be tested live. Copying an element or document copies the whole tree below that node, too.
