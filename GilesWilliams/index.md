UK Student, trying to learn Cocoa as Ia realised how useless BASIC was! Run a Little Hosting business at http://www.qlehosting.com/

Trying to sift through old projects to pu on my new portfolio site http://www.qlehosting.com/giles/

**Languages I Speak:**

*PHP
*HTML
*JavaScript
*CSS
*REALbasic

Hope to have some fun learning Cocoa, it seems pretty hot even after about a week learning! :)
