Apple's directory system for storing "network administrative information". It's where users, groups and other such things are stored in MacOSX 10.4 and earlier. The public interface for NetInfo is provided by OpenDirectory. NetInfo no longer exists in 10.5. See man 5 netinfo, and the nicl/niutil/nidump command-line utilities for more information.
