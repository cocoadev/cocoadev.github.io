Macintosh IIci. I guess it could also be the Apple IIci. But the Mac IIci was even cooler. Mine is standing on end behind my iMac! Eventually I'll either run NetBSD on it or 7.5.5 and MachTen. Maybe. Right now it's running A/UX, but I can't get that to recognize the network card :( -- RobRix

The IIci was my first Mac.  It was a wonderful computer.  I learned hypercard, C, C++ on it. Good memories!--AlexanderD

Ahhh... HyperCard is glorious. I got it on a Mac Plus, and then an LC, and then a 6100, and then a 6500...
