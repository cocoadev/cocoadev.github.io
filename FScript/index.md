F-Script is a lightweight object-oriented interactive and scripting layer specifically designed for Cocoa. F-Script provides scripting and interactive access to Cocoa frameworks and custom Objective-C objects. It aims to be a useful and fun tool for both beginners and experts, allowing interactively exploring, testing and using Cocoa-based objects and frameworks. It includes a smalltalk-like scripting language and a powerful graphical object browser for interacting with Cocoa objects. It also includes support for CoreData in the form of CoreDataExplorer, a set of tools for exploring and manipulating CoreData objects. F-Script is based on the OOPALProgrammingModel, a high level programming model for querying and manipulating objects.
F-Script is open source.

Just thought I'd add some graffiti: FScript and FScriptAnywhere are SO useful! Especially if you've ever gotten used to say, using python and Tk to prototype an app... -- MichaelMcCracken

The thing I like most about FScript is FScriptAnywhere. If you've ever wanted to explore someone else's Cocoa app, this is the way to do it. One click and you can load the FScript interpreter into any running Cocoa app and have interactive access to its internals. Try it! -- PeterMonty
