Is it possible to apply a custom icon to a screen saver bundle?

----

If it doesn't work in Xcode changing the app icon, then you can open the info window in the finder with the xx.saver app selected. Select the little icon ( blue border ) and past the Icon you want there. The size can be 128*128. HTH

Take a look at the Info.plist inside the .saver bundle.
