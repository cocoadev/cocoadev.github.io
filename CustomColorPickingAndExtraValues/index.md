title: CustomColorPickingAndExtraValues

I used NSColorPicker <NSColorPickingCustom> to create my custom color picker.
I added a slider for red, green and blue and text fields.
I also need two extra values (filter and transmit) and adding those to the color picker is no problem but getting those values in my subclass of NSColorWell is something else.

Is this possible at all or should look for something else?
