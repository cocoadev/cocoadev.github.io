title: ShuttingDownTheComputerWithCocoa
---

Hi.

I wrote an app that locks the screen. There should be a button that should shut down the computer. But I don't really know how to do that - or where to begin to look. I've already searched cocoadev with "turn off" and "shut down", but there were no results I could use.

Thanks in advance!

Google is your friend. So is cocoabuilder.com. Try http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1134.html - they key is kAEShutDown
