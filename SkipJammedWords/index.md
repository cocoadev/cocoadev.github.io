Is there a way to skip the cursor, using the keyboard, to the next, or the previous capital letter in a jammed word.  Eg: My cursor is in at the beginning of the string *ThisIsAnExample".  Can I hit some key stroke that will take me to to *IsAnExample* and then to *AnExample* etc?

Ooops.  I forgot to qualify that.  Is there a way to do that in any GUI text editor anybody knows of... and specifically, can I get Xcode to do that for me?

You could probably do it with an AppleScript somehow.

Or an InputManager?

ctrl+option+left/right-arrow gets my vote as the combo since option+left/right-arrow is the standard for moving by word.
