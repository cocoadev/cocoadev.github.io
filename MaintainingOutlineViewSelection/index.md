title: MaintainingOutlineViewSelection
---

I have an outlineview that supports drag and drop.  Everything works fine, and I can drop an item into the folder and the model is updated properly.  My problem lies in updating the outlineview.  While the outlineview properly reflects the move operation, it collapses everything and selects the first row every time someone drags and drops a file.  How can I maintain the selection and currently expanded items when an outlineview's data is being reloaded?
