ScriptingLanguages (like JavaScript, AppleScript, and FScript) are usually high-level languages used primarily for (you guessed it) scripting. They make it easy to make simple programs, although they're not generally fast enough for use in application programming (beyond making your application scriptable).

See also ScriptingLanguage.
