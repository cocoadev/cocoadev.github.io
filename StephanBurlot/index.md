Current Cocoa projects:


* General/PiX - Calculate PI with a jillion decimals.
* General/WakeUp - Wakes up your machines remotely by sending them a network packet.
* General/SafariFix - Quick hack to solve a vulnerability in General/MacOSX. Since Unsanity released Paranoid Android, and since Apple did release a fix, this is useless. Code is available, though, if you want to know how to install a handler for a specific protocol.
* General/SafariBookmarkChecker - checks the validity of safari bookmarks really fast using parallel threads.
