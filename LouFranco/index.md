As of 8/12/2004: Just started developing on my Mac with XCode -- version 1.5 is finally good enough.  Primarily a Java developer. Made the "switch" from Windows about 2 weeks ago because I wanted one machine that could handle my development and lifestyle environments.

I have a long C/C++ background, so it won't be long before I start writing all of my apps in ObjectiveC.
