How would I go about implementing the General/TableView Line Separator now used in many apps including the finder, as shown below between 'External Storage' and 'Applications'?

And does anyone know how to leave a space at the top, 3 pixel gap between the top of the tableview and the selection?

Are you sure that isn't an General/NSMenuView? --zootbobbalu
