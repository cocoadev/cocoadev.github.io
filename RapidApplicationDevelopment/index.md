RapidApplicationDevelopment (RAD) is the process of creating an application from a prototype (e.g., AppKit & Foundation), modifying as needed, instead of writing new code. A true RAD workflow includes a GUI design tool (InterfaceBuilder).

NeXTComputer shook the computing world with the introduction of RAD in the early 90's, and continues to innovate with Cocoa.
