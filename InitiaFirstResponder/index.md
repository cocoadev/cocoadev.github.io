Describe InitiaFirstResponder here.

I have a Main Window with a push button which loads another window which has
 a NSTextField and I have connected a NSTextField as the
initialFirstResponder for the window in IB. This window is loaded ( when we press push button on main window) and
displayed but the field is not selected(focused) .
Is there any way to get the window to highlight the
initialFirstResponder?  
thanks
