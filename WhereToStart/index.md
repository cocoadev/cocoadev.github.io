title: WhereToStart

The useful portions of the discussion on this page, about how to get going with programming when you do not even know C yet, have been refactored onto the General/GettingStarted page.

This page is one of those such that, if it didn't exist, it would have to be invented, and would be, sooner or later. As such it is a canonical page title, like General/NewbieQuestion or General/WhereToBegin. If it gets deleted, somebody will reinvent it.

If you are just General/GettingStarted, that page is a good jumping off point. If you feel you have special needs that aren't covered there, or if you've started to apprehend the vastness and flexibility of Cocoa and General/ObjectiveC, feel free to post your insights or just dish a little, below:
