Describe PalmOSDevelopment here. - It's frustrating!

*From a discussion on PalmOS*:

Slightly off-topic for CocoaDev, but I have yet to find any way to develop PalmOS programs on MacOSX.  Could someone point me in the right direction? (feel free to remove this if it's too OT)

Simplicity offers a Java tool called Simplicity for Palm that is good (as well as Simplicity for MIDP, which will work for both Palm and Windows PDAs). I use both on Mac OS X. The only problem is that you cannot create .prc files on a Mac -- you need a PC to do that. :-P  Of course, you can probably do that step on VirtualPC.

Check out the page: http://www.zenonez.com/prctoolsx/try.html prc-tools is a gcc-based environment for palm dev. It works well enough on OS X, except for a problem I've been having with PalmBlueToothDevelopment. If anyone knows some secrets, please post on that page! Thanks...
