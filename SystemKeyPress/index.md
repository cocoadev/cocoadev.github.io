Is there any way to detect a key press (no matter where it occurred)?  Is there some notification you can register for?  I'd like my app to be able to recognize system wide key presses regardless of where the key is pressed, and regardless of what key it is (i.e. not just modifier keys).

Thanks.

Thanks, but this seems to be only for specific hot keys.  I want to catch every single key press, regardless of whether it is using a modifier key or not.
