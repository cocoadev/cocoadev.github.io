I've played around with computers ever since I was little and had long hair. I got really turned on by Objective C and Cocoa when OS X and Project Builder came out. As a biologist, I'm interested to see whether by modelling the complex reactions that go on inside cells I can provide new insights into how things really work. So far, I haven't made much progress, but I'm persistent. It's what I do for fun in the wee hours when my insomnia has got the better of me. At present I'm trying to model how DNA replication is controlled. I do the wet side of this for my day job: more details at http://www.dundee.ac.uk/biocentre/SLSBDIV3jjb.htm.

Apart from mol. biol. and programming, I play with my kids, climb mountains and listen to Yes. I also like to drink beer.
