Where is the Framework that has all the images for Sherlock in Panther?

I believe you are talking about the Sherlock SDK which is located at http://developer.apple.com/macosx/sherlock/.

I'm actually   talking about the "Stocks" Toolbar image in Sherlock 3. I should of specified. Sorry!

I had a look around and I think it's in HIToolbox.rsrc. I *think* Iconographer can open and extract items from .rsrc files, but don't quote me on that. Sorry I couldn't be more help - blame Apple for hiding the damn thing so thoroughly!
