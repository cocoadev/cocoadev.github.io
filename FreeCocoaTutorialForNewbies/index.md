The original (temporal) announcement on this page (which was more of a Help Wanted) was moved to CocoaDevBulletinBoard

If you have a new link to *your own* unique tutorial text, pitched at newbie level, consider posting it here. It could gather comment on this page. CocoaTutorials lists well-known sites for this sort of thing, so you probably don't need to re-list them here.
