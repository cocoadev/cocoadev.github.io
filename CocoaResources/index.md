***Offline Resources** (no Cocoa/ObjC books please, put those in CocoaBooks)


**The C Programming Language* by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie

For all of your C programming needs, also not such a bad book to learn from.  This book is the authority on C. Just make sure you get the Second Edition, which covers ANSI C. The old First Edition still covered so-called K&R C, which is *old*.

**Practical C Programming* by Steve Oualline

An excellent intro to C programming for the beginner and newbie.  Check it out at O'Reilly's site: http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pcp3/
