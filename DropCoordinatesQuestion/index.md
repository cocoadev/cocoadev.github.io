I need to find out how get the mouse coordinates when dropping an item into a custom view. I expected to get a mouseUp after concludeDragOperation that I could use, but it does not occur.

This development project is on a tight deadline, and any help would be greatly appreciated.

Doesnt dragginginfo hold that kind of data?

Thanks for pointing out the extremely obvious to me. I have been relying on examples from the books that I have rather than taking a good long look at the documentation.
