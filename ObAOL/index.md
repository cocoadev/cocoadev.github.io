Describe ObAOL here.

The "Ob*" construct is old net-news slang for "Obligatory (whatever)".  Like on alt.tasteless, if you posted something that wasn't tasteless, you could attach an "ObTasteless: you should have seen what my dog did last night.

ObAOL would be 'obligatory AOL (slam)', usually followed by "Me Too"
