*Bruce Tognazzini (http://www.asktog.com), who usually has quite a lot to say about the state of interface design at Apple. Both Bruce and Donald have been Apple employees.

*Eric Raymond (OpenSource evangelist) has some things to say as to the state of interface design in the open source world: http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cups-horror.html

*Too lazy (and bandwidth-deficient) to find the link at the moment, but John Gruber should definitely be mentioned here, especially given his comments on Eric Raymond's CUPS horrors. http://www.daringfireball.net/
