I've visited this site quite a lot of times and it's great. It's one of the places I look when I'm stuck with my programming...

I'm learning Cocoa and have managed to finish a game with it and OpenGL. It's on my site: http://www.makasoft.net 

Now I'm working on another game, trying to do some network programming... we'll see how it goes ;) I have 0 experience on that matter... 

A topic that interests me a lot in game programming is the usage of pseudo random (or just random) numbers to create content, worlds, levels, missions, etc... I love Elite and Frontier, which used this technique to create a whole universe of planets and stars. And I also love Rogue like games (Nethack and others). All these are games that the programers can enjoy exaclty as any other user!!

I also love music, and play the trumpet a bit... you can check the music of my band at: http://www.elcirculodewillis.com
