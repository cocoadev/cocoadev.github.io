Started programming the Apple ][ in Basic and 6502 while I was still in college in 1979. And somehow I ended up here.

Since the release of DR2 I try to work in Cocoa whenever possible but occasionally find myself doing other distasteful things.

I tinker with a website at http://icantrecall.com and can be contacted there.
