My current project is a text editor which I hope to release around september (which is very soon!) 2004. See http://macromates.com/

And I recently started a blog: http://sigpipe.macromates.com/ which I only intend to use for stuff related to Cocoa and/or programming (i.e. tips, tricks, tutorials, and sources) so signup for the RSS feed!

Google for my name if you need to know more about me! ;)

You have some nice tips on your blog.  Keep it up!  --- Bruce
