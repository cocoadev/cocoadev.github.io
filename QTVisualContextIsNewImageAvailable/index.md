Hello. I need to get frames out of streaming media source (rtp). The stream is perfectly playable with QuickTime Player, but not with QTMovie. With QTMovie I got only three or five frames of video, while audio works perfectly, after video freezes. I got QTCoreVideo101 and replace initialize of QTMovie from file to initialization with NSURL.

Please help!
