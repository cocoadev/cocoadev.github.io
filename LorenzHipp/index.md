I am a Student of Computer Science at the University of Applied Science in Sankt Augustin, Germany.

I am developing mainly some convenient Frameworks for general and special use, like for QuickTime, SQLite and OpenGL.
Some apps are also in development, but still in beta- or proof-of-concept-phase.

In the next months all the source code, examples and hints I collected so far, will be published on my homepage http://www.irdisch.de.

In my spare free time, I am also co-developing, porting some apps, like xCHM, GENtle OSX, iEat (Control Center).

Feel free to contact me, if you have any questions. 
Oh, and by the way, sorry that most of my homepage is still not available in english...  =)
