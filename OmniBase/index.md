title: OmniBase
---



OmniBase is the lowest level framework in the Omni framework suite. It provides a series of debugging aids for class allocation and initialization, an alternative assertions mechanism, several Objective-C runtime manipulation aids, and a very reliable, cross-platform implementation of +load (called +didLoad).

An Omni Version of assert is included, also extensions to NSObject mainly for debugging. There is an implementation to do MethodSwizzling on classes.
