Describe General/TibetSprague here.

I'm a student at Brown University in Providence, RI. Currently I am taking an independent study with a friend researching structure oriented editing. We hope to create our own improved structure oriented programmer's editor with the front end written in Cocoa.

Other languages I have experience with include Java, C++, Scheme, Mumps, Tcl/Tk
