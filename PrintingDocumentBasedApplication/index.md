**Description** 

I am trying to get the printing to work in a Document-based Application. So far I have not succeeded. Is there someone that has an easy example on this...

Just found that in a google search while I was looking for something else. Haven't looked at it much, but it mentions NSDocument, so maybe it'll help.

There is also a sophisticated discussion about printing complicated graphics in PrintingInADocumentBasedApp
