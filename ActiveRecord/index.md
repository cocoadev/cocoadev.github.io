**ActiveRecord** is a very easy to use database framework written by ninja kitten ( http://ninjakitten.us )
It should look very familiar to developers that have worked with rails.

ActiveRecord can be found at http://github.com/aptiva/activerecord/tree

This is very cool! Sadly, the examples are down on ninjakitten's website. :-(

There is a similar implementation for Cocoa called SQLitePeristentObjects. It's identical to the ActiveRecord design pattern, but driven from the object's properties rather than by existing database tables, and is very easy to implement.
