I was trying to use a keychain in my program. I found the documentation for Keychain Services but I'm still lost. I don't get what functions I need to call to do the following. I want to allow a user to specify a computer to connect to along with a user name and password and store the information in a keychain. Then when they want to connect to it, automatically use that information so a window doesn't pop up requesting it. I was looking at the documentation and couldn't figure out if I needed to create a keychain, open a keychain, or what.

If you don't mind having the system use the label is account name then I posted code together with my question on how to change the KeyChainItemLabel. --AllanOdgaard
