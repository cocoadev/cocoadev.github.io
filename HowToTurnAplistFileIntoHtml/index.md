I made an app that saves data from a table in a plist file.  I would like to add a function to export this plist to an html file.  
Is it possible?  If so please provide some guidence!!!     EricColon

It is possible.  You will need to decide how to write the key-value pairs into HTML.  I suggest one pair per line or
the key on one line, with the value on the next.

OmniOutliner (http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/ ) will display the contents of a plist if you drag and drop the file on the application.  This
outline or key-value pairs can be exported in HTML.
