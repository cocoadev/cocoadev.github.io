Hi, everybody!

I was wondering, if one of you knew how to change the dock icon of an application (not of your own, but.. let's say, iTunes' dock icon)... I would love to set iTunes' dock icon to the cover art... Is that possible?

Thanks,
oddy

There is no public API with which to do this. You may want to check out the much-debated ApplicationEnhancer for a hackish work-around.
