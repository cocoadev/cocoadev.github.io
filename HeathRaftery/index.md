Heath is by day working on the inferior platform, researching and programming apps for condition monitoring. His main coding interest is his alterego: H<nowiki/>R<nowiki/>S<nowiki/>oftW<nowiki/>orks: http://www.hrsoftworks.net

Original items of note are Corroboree (group network collaboration), Authoxy (authenticating proxy) and X<nowiki/>W<nowiki/>ordL<nowiki/>ookup (Dashboard widget), but Heath also has his hand in the products of a few other companies, via contract work. And he's interested in more ;)
