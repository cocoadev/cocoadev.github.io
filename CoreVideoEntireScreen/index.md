Hey

Does anyone know how to apply Core Image/video effects to the entire screen. I mean the actual mac os x. So the dock bar, the menu the background, all of it live. Like the ICC in colour sync (I know completely different, just an example of how it effects everything). I orginally tried a quick hack of just taking a snapshot and placing that up real quickly (hence making sort of a video). 

In short is there anyway to grab screen output at the framebuffer and pipe it through a filter first?

thanks
