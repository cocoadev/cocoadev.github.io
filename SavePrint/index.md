I have a document-based application. 

However, the "save"and "print "button I need to implement are NOT in the main window--- this means that I can not implement print and save by overwrite NSDocuments' methods?? 

Print and save buttons  sit in another window: "MyWindow" which extends NSWindowController, and need to operate "save","save as" and "print" for a textView area in the MyWindow. How could I do it? Any example?

Thanks a lot
Phyllis
