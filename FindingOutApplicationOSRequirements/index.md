title: FindingOutApplicationOSRequirements
---

I have developed an application that right now has around 10.000 lines of code. To build it, I have gathered information from different sources.

My question is: how do I find out, without having to try it on every single one, for which Mac OS X version this app is valid? Is there some sort of analytical tool that helps you find the required OS X version for your apps?

Thanks.

Nope, you just have to try it. But it's not as bad as it sounds. For most applications there are really only two versions of OS X to try: 10.3.9 and the latest version of 10.4. If you really insist, you can include 10.2.8. There's no point in even testing any of the other bugfix releases, since they all have free updates up to the end of the major release.
