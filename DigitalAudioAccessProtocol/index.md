The Digital Audio Access Protocol, or DAAP, is used by Apple's  iTunes 4.0 digital audio player to share music across a network  or the Internet. It provides capability not only to stream audio  from one computer to another, but also to list the host's playlists  so that they can be accessed remotely.
