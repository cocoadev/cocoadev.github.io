DefaultsManager is an editor for the User Defaults (Preferences) database on Mac OS X. It allows you to easily view, edit, delete, and backup preferences that are stored in the User Defaults database. It can be used to view and change the preferences in almost any application. As a developer, you can use it to make sure your preferences are being stored and changed correctly. As a user you can use it to unlock features that previously required the use of Terminal.
