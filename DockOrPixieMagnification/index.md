title: DockOrPixieMagnification

I want to be able to magnify stuff like in the Dock or like in Pixie? (Developer Tools/Graphic Tools).
Mike Matas has implemented a Dock-like magnification in Catscan but I'm looking for something more like NSColorPanel's Magnification Glass tool where it doesnt have the bend effect.

P.S. if you could help me attach the magnification to my cursor and get it like NSColorPanel's mag tool.. that'd be great.

Thanks alot.

*Each icon in the dock is it's own window, the dock then uses core services to magnify or demish the windows. Hope this helps.*
