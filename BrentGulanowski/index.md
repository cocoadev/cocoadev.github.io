Cocoa Developer at MarketcircleInc since 2007-05. Work on Daylite and Daylite Server (just released a month ago). Still want to make digital toys/games and such, some day. Always looking for someone to team up with to do some laid back work on the side. I've got lots of ideas. I'm sure you do, too.

I'm more of a back-end coder, so can't always help much with nitty gritty AppKit issues. Been working a lot with Core Data, Security, networking and other infrastructure-type stuff. Long way from being a true expert, though.

I only drop by around here once in a while, but this page was getting sorely out of date.
