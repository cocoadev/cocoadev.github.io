I've been on the Mac since 1986 (Lightspeed C, anyone?) but ironically developed a career as a Windows programmer (never could find that Mac dev job, or someone else to start a company with).

I still do Windows by day (system-level stuff: services, S<nowiki/>DKs, some device driver work) but I've been getting into Cocoa more and more and hope to one day be living "the life" (http://daringfireball.net/2005/10/the_life)
