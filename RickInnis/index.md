RickInnis is a geek of all trades currently resident in Toronto, Canada. Although not given to talking about himself in the third person it seems appropriate here. Over the past 20 years he has hacked in Pascal, C, LISP, Scheme, Prolog, Java, C++ and Objective-C. His collection of obsolete hardware includes a NeXT Cube, a NeXTStation, a beige G3, a white iBook and an MDD G4. Currently hacking on a wee Cocoa app that will change the world, if only in a small way.
