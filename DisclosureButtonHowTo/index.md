How do I make Disclosure Buttons work? I have no idea. I'm creating an Info panel and i would like to able to collapse its sections... Any tutorial on it? Tips? Anything that might help? Thanx

In Panther, activating a disclosure triangle will set the **hidden** property of a view. You then have to resize the window appropriately, or something.

In Jaguar, you can use an NSDisclosureButtonCell.

Also, WindowOrPanelThatResizesAutomaticallyWhenItsContentChangesSize might help.

Thank You for the information. Suits perfectly with my needs.
