Started my programming career on the NeXT in 1994. Recent years has been mostly WebObjects and, as is the case for PeterLindberg, Cocoa programming is mostly a spare time activity.

I have a blog at http://tancred.com/malte/blog/ (english) and http://tancred.com/malte/reflekterar/ (swedish). See ya!
