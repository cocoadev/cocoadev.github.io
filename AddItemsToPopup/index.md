Hi--

I'm just building my first interface, and find that when I look in the Attributes for a pop-up menu, it doesn't show how to add additional items to the menu other than the default number of three. I looked through the help files and online at Apple's dev site, and there's no information (that I can find) there either.

Am I missing something? I just need to add three more items to my menu for a total of six selections.

Thanks :)

Is it possible this isn't mentioned anywhere else on the site? It doesn't seem to be, even though it's certainly a CommonProblem.

You can add items to your NSPopUpButton by simply dragging menu items in from the menu palette in InterfaceBuilder. They're menus just like the menus in your MainMenu.nib, and so you can manipulate them as such.
