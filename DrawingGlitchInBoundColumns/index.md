title: DrawingGlitchInBoundColumns
---

I've connected the columns in a table to an array controller (through bindings) to display the contents, but there seems to be a drawing glitch so that cells always get a white background which breaks the alternating row colours. I think I've seen this mentioned before but I can't find any info on CocoaDev. Does anyone have a solution to this?
