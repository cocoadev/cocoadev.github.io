I am 22 and the only programmer on the AssignmentTrackerX Project to create a Mac OS X app to aid students in keeping track of assignments & grades. I am always trying to expand my knowlege of the Cocoa Framework by working on my project and trying to help other Cocoa Programmers by sharing my Source Code under the GPL.
