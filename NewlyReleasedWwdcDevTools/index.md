I'm trying to find out if there are any significant changes in the dev tools recently released on the ADC from the  WWDC.

Depends what you mean by significant.  :)  Nothing too major has changed on the surface, but it seems like a number of under-the-hood bug fixes and so on.

One thing I did notice is that the GDB included with CodeWarrior Pro 7 EA is more recent than the one on Apple's WWDC dev tools disk.  CW debugging is coming close to being usable on OS X, barring the speed issues.

Is this an official development tool review, Steven? Something along the lines of CocoaTools or CocoaReviews?

Personally, I've seen nothing major, but I updated anyhow, partly because I enjoy updating my software (I am indeed a geek), and partly because I wanted to get that WO5 trial anyhow...

Should be fun!

Check the release notes? I think there were some bugfixes to PB and IB, amongst other things...

The new PB crashes alot, and I haven't noticed any new features. They're there, but none of them is so drastic that I've noticed ;) So my advice is unless there's a particular reason you need to upgrade, you might as well stick with 1.0
