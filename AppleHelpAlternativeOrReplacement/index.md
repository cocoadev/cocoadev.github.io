title: AppleHelpAlternativeOrReplacement
---

I'm looking for an alternative way to provide help in my application. With the current stagnant status of AppleHelp (counter-productive and useless 'always on top' window since leopard, loss of live CSS styling in pages, and now the "no you can't troubleshoot what's going on" disabling of debugging mode in 10.6), AH is becoming more a hindrance than actual help.

I remember a couple of years ago seeing an alternative tool out that replicated the OS9's AppleGuide functionality (for example, the help hints provided by circle-highliting a UI element) in a OS X app/help system. I can't find it again however.

Has anyone else ever seen it, and know what it's called?

How about KNAppGuide?
