hi,
does somebody around here know how to implant the Omnigroup OAInspector's ?
i've tried asking on the omni-dev-list but nobody there knows (odd...)

...
i have an outline view with in it delegate-class the required implantation-methods, i've got an Class called Inspector which responds to the OAInspectorProtocol, i've got Nib file with with a view in it and the inspector-class as file's owner, the view is connected to the file's owner's view outlet which i defined in the inspector-class and which is returned by the appropriate method (forgot it's name)
what is going wrong ?

or can somebody explain me how i should implant this functionality..

many thanks on advance
