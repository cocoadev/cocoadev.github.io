Just a placeholder for now.

Performance test engineer based out of New York.

Have had a Mac in use since 1984. Programming Macs since 1986 as a hobbyist, except for a nice stint in the mid-nineties as a Codewarrior C person. Sigh.

I am currently biased towards Smalltalk and Lisp-like environments.
