Hello all, I'm new here at the time of writing this.

I've been programming for a few years, I know Objective-C, C++, Python, PHP, HTML/CSS. Javascript, a tiny bit of Java (But who cares :D). I aspire to be a programmer or computer engineer or something along the lines of computer science when I get older, but for now I'm just enjoying my little projects. I own a company* and I do some software development, but more on that later.

I used to play a lot of games, so if you want to talk about them, I will, but I don't play a lot anymore.

I'm also somewhat versed in the topics of, but not limited to:

- Filthy Dubstep
- Filthy Calculus
- Physics
- Mathematics
- Call of Duty 4 (The best one)
- Minecraft
- Music Production
- Ultimate Frisbee
- Being Tall

*Ok, fine, "company" is just me and an ABN, but I like to call it a company.

clayjones.me is my site, but I hardly ever post there. I mostly use it for school.
