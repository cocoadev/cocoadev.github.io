I'm creating a document-based Cocoa application and my Info.plist file has been corrupted. Is there a �stock� Info.plist I could borrow (open file types: txt, html, htm, rtf)?

*Just create a new project, set it up however you like, and copy the Info.plist over to your original project.*

that doesn't seem to have fixed it. now my app won't launch at all.

Can you give any console messages or maybe even the text of the Info.plist file?  How did you corrupt the Info.plist file?
