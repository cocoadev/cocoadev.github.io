A General/UtilityClass is a class which provides a specialized function and is highly reusable. For instance, the General/FoundationKit's General/NSArray, General/NSDictionary, General/NSSet, and General/NSString classes can all be seen as being a General/UtilityClass, because they are useful without needing subclassing.
