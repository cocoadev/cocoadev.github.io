General/UbikWiki is a Wiki engine by the same guy who brought page history, topics and footnotes to this site, General/KritTer. It's showcasing a new breed of Wiki engine, and it has nothing whatsoever to do with General/CocoaDev**'elopment.

It's clever. -- General/RobRix**'General/WhoWasImpressedByIt.
