I'm a student in the UK, currently working on a General/PhD in bioinformatics at the University of Nottingham. When not putting the finishing touches to my thesis, I can be found hacking on some Cocoa code from my 15" Al General/PowerBook.

When relatively new to Cocoa, I managed to pick up a few hints and tips from the excellent O'Reilly Cocoa books. I then got hooked following a couple of Apple sponsored trips to WWDC in 2003 and 2004, and am now working on a number of projects, ranging from machine learning to RSS feeds and sometimes, both.

Oh - and The MZA thing? Don't ask.
