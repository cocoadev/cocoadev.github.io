HTMLRendering (/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/HTMLRendering.framework) is the Cocoa framework that Apple is currently providing us for simple HTML rendering views. It was never a public API- it was just used for simple HTML rendering in programs like Help Viewer and Mail.

Obsoleted by the far superior, publicly-usable WebKit.

I still prefer GhettoWeb over Safari any day!
