Describe SelectSubviewOfNSSplitView here.

I have an NSSplitView with 2 subviews.
I can click in either subview to activate it, but I want to control this programmatically.
I can not find any way to achieve this.
I have tried sending performClick to one of the views (which is NSTableView) as a last resort, but this does not work.
