I've been playing around with the Sherlock 3 SDK a bit. Basic modifications of the default template went fine, but I can't figure out how to use a General/NSBrowser with General/XQuery.

Is there any sample code out there that shows how to get data from the web and display it in an General/NSBrowser?
