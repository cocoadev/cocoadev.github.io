For anyone who is new to Cocoa and is afraid to post a discussion (I know I was long ago), feel free to contact myself or anyone who adds their name to this list.

Check out HowToProgramInOSX and let me know what you think here.  It is just a draft, so please add your insight to it.

Also, there's often somebody in the CocoaDev ChatRoom who'll be happy to help (but it is rarely active).
