Basically it's wireless networking - allowing speeds of up to 11Mbps at a range of about 150 feet from the base-station.

To use Airport you will need an AirPort card and a compatible Mac.

update: (Jan 2003)

Apple has announced AirPort Extreme (802.11g) - circa 50Mbps

(Does anyone else hate the Apple "Extreme" branding?  It sounds so 80s - What's next Radical Ethernet?  Bodacious Bluetooth?) - DiggoryLaycock
