From http://developer.apple.com/java/faq/#anchor2 I quote:

*
"2: Where is Java 1.5 (J2SE 5.0)?

Developer Preview 7 of J2SE 5.0 Release 1 is now available at the ADC Download Site. The preview requires Mac OS X v10.4 Tiger Build 8A425, also available on the ADC Download Site to seed key holders.  Access to pre-release Apple software is discussed in the ADC Frequently Asked Questions.  There are currently no plans to release J2SE 5.0 for Mac OS X Panther or any earlier releases. "
*


My question is, will I be able to download Java 1.5 from connect.apple.com when my copy of Tiger arrives on the 29th.  Right now, when I log in, I don't see the option to download Java J2SE 5.0 Release 1.

Has anyone heard from Apple or have any insight on the matter?

ps.  Please don't get into a religious war about Java on this wiki page.

My guess is, if you have a seed key, you can see and download it. Cuz I have a key, and I can see it on the ADC. *How very insightful.*

"How very insightful." How very stand-offish and superior.

Well, at least it isn't a Java-religious war that seems to be starting...

Do I remember correctly that Apple released a developer preview (even for those with a free developer account) of Java 1.4?  That's why I ask.  -General/JoeCrow

For anyone that cares, Java 1.5 Release 1 is available from Apple as a separate download.  See this link: http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/java2se50release1.html -General/JoeCrow

Just note that 1.5 only works with Tiger. So for those still running 10.3.x, don't bother to download it ;-)

*This really sucks for those of us stuck with Panther. Is there any technical reason why Apple/Sun couldn't be bothered to port 1.5 to 10.3?*

I don't know about a technical reason, but I can think of a business reason ;-)
