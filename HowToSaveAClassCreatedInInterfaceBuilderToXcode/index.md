Once you create a class in Interface Builder, you can save it to XCode.  This will create an implementation file (yourClass.m) and an interface file (yourClass.h).  It will also include all the outlets and action methods you have created so far.

To do this, you must be in Interface Builder.  Go to the Classes menu and choose "Create Files for myClass" where "myClass" is the name of your class.  Follow the directions and it will create a new .h and .m files for XCode.
