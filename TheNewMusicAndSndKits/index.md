**The new General/MusicKit and General/SndKit, are they good?**

Yes, that�s the question. How are this both kits in usage and performance?

Ok, sorry for that, how to delete a page?

Well, I'm trying to use those under OS X on my new flat panel iMac. I got sound playing, stopping and pausing/resuming. Now trying to get the record to work for the built-in internal mic. I've searched dejanews and google and it looks like I'm about the 3rd guy in the world either doing this or having problems with it, so not many people seem to be using it on OS X.

No deleting information on this site. It's there forever. We can make it generic "Describe General/TheNew here", though...
