I have a few questions, and I can't find the answers anywhere!

Heres my setup:  Powerebook w/ 17" monitor in the DVI output and TV in the svideo output.  To watch TV I have to pull the monitor out of its DVI socket.

So I want to write a program which switches to the svideo output from the DVI output and back again.  Also, I then want to be able to switch which screen is the main display - I use VLC for almost everything, and it is set to use the second display (tv) but when I want to watch WMV files I use the MS win media player, which needs the TV to be the main display.  As I use VLC most I like have the main display on my laptop monitor, so I can work whilst the TV playing as well.

Any pointers / clues?

Cheers,  Tom


*Such.... helpful... advice. If ever an answer on this wiki deserved a pointer to General/HowToWriteHelpfulAnswers, this one does. If your response does not contribute, then why post it at all?*

Be patient. If * is older than about age 14, I shall be most surprised. One thing we do know, he discovered Carbon and just had to tell us. General/CocoaDev has always had its Joshas. Now we have a *.

Not to worry folks, I seem to have found what I needed now.  Theres a Carbon Display Manager library.

... so the answer began with a k?

I'll admit I'm a noob at this stuff. Forgive me for my "advice". I will definitly review the General/HowToWriteHelpfulAnswers. I just came across this site during my comp science class and was doing a couple things at once.

P.S. Feel free to delete this as it is a pointless confession

Feel free to qoute that for beginners at this (seeing how I am one). Sounds like some Monty Python sketch: "The answer starts with a k"
