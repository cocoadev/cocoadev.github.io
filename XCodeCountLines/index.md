Does anyone know a way (or have an script) that can count all the lines of code in an General/XCode project? Just curious.

*Just write an app that runs through all the files in your project folder, sees if it is a .m or .h, and count the number of /n's.*

There is a discussion somewhere on here that demonstrates doing this, but I dont know what it was called, and haven't been able to find it.

*See General/HowToFindAmountOfLinesInProject*
