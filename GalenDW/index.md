My name is Galen D. W. I've been developing widgets for a few years now, and I've also been doing web design for a number of years. I'm also proud to be a Cocoa newbie. I live in the state of Colorado.

Languages I Know:

Obviously, I'm also learning Objective-C... but I shouldn't have to say that.
