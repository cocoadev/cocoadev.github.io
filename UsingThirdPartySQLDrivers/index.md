Hey all, I have a quick question. For work I use SQL Server on a daily basis.  I am working on a few things that may very much benifit from some small custom apps, but I have no idea how to connect to a SQL Server database.  I have purchased a driver that allows some other apps to communicate with the server and I am wondering if I can write an app to access the server as well by using that driver.  Basically what I'm looking to do is:

Send typed / auto generated SQL Statements to the Server
Handle messages returned by the server
Return result sets of data and perform operations on them

Generally the basic SQL functionality.

Is there a good place to start looking for this information?

Thanks for any info you might be able to share

You will have to be more specific about this. What kind of a driver did you purchase? JDBC?
