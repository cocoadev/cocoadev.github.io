Server's down now.

On the plus side, this site is now using the modifications. Cheers Steven! -- General/KritTer

I've made a new version of the code that runs this site, to store the history of each page. I would appreciate experimentation and comments.

I should make clear that the new code can happily use an old database, so no conversion will be required to use the new feature.

And, yes, I know I misspelled the name of this page :)

Checking it out now. And amusing typo, General/KritTer my boy.

"The page you have requested is currently unavailable" - damn Internet Explorer on General/WinXP. This is a horrible mess of a system. Anyhow.

Experiments in Wikiland are encouraged by me, they lead to really interesting stuff. I obviously am currently unable to properly review it, but hey, it sure *sounds* neat.

Add a journalling file system (didn't the BFS guy just join Apple or something?!), and we've got ourselves a winner for sure! Imma be just fine, I promise.

Alrighty, turns out General/BrickHouse was only half opening port 80, so people in my college could see the page but nobody else. Great. Fancy trying again?

Ah, okay, working fine. Looks pretty excellent to me! Nice job there! -- General/RobRix
