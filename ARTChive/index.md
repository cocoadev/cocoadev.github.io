I'm currently writing an app that reads/writes album artwork to the ARTChive (~/Library/Images/Music) and I haven't been able to find any documentation for it so I was hoping you guys could verify that I'm doing it correctly, here's the way I make the directory structure:


*artist


*album


*albumname.tiff



*artist2


*album


*albumname.tiff




I'm _pretty_ sure this is correct, but if anyone can point me to a specification or something for the artchive that would be absolutely great!
