New SpellCatcherX feature that uses accessibility and TSM / NSTextInput APIs to extract text and attributes from the underlying document, in order to render a transparent overlay window showing the errors in the document.

Works in any app that supports the Mac OS X Dictionary panel (command-control-d, while hovering over a word).
