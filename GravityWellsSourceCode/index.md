title: GravityWellsSourceCode

I've decided to release the source code for my latest Cocoa game under the GNU GPL License. You can get it at: http://www.makasoft.net/cgi/mk/mk.pl/GravityWells_Source

It's not very elegant, but I'm still learning... 

Things the game does that may be useful:



*Creates a window (may be full screen) with an opengl context.
*Implements a kind of "tile world" with quads and textures.
*Handles Mouse and Keyboard events.
*Uses NSDate objects to examine frame rates and adapts game physics and speed.
*Some simple particle effects
*Uses the Class QTSoundFilePlayer by Kurt Revis to play mp3 sound files.
