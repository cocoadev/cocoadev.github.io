How is the name derived from? What are associations?

    * Quantum = small, micro, but still a unity that can't be divided any more
    * i.e. fitting for handheld devices like PDAs and Smartphones
    * STEP = in the history of NextSTEP, OpenSTEP, GNUstep 

So, QuantumSTEP is a Mac-like Application Platform that can be installed on existing Linux devices (Zaurus, Nokia 770) aiming at highest level of useage, data and application compatibility allowing for perfect data exchange and sync.

It is founded on very powerful software technology frameworks which have been ground-breaking when originally introduced: NextStep/OpenStep (developed by NeXT and Apple) as well as the X Window System (developed by MIT) and Linux.
