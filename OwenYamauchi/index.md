Owen Yamauchi... well, he's just migrated to Cocoa from REALbasic. He still writes RB stuff, though, and is a leading authority in, uh, his neighborhood on RB. He thinks RB is not that bad of an IDE - it's just that Cocoa is better. In the 5 years he's been writing in RB, he's managed to accumulate a giant amount of useless crap on his HD. Now he can continue the trend with Cocoa, only with more separate files! Yay!

Anyway, he wants a G5, so if someone would like to send him one, please feel free to do so. Include a 23" Cinema Display with the shipment. And a PB G4 (17") for good measure. Already got an iPod, thanks.

I'll be attending Carnegie Mellon University's (birthplace of Mach kernel and alma mater of Avie Tevanian) School of Computer Science in fall 2005. Woot!

How about a metre ruler for good measure, instead? :) I could send you one but I don't know what the postage is like for long thin things.

Hey, someone who shares my name!  Welcome to the club, Owen!  --OwenAnderson

**Does this put the Owens on par with the Finlays?**

Hey dude, could you tell me how on earth you learned Obj-C in an hour?!?! I'm havng a heck of a time trying to learn it....

If you already know C, Obj-C is very little addiitonal information.  The intro books (like #  BookCocoaProgMacOSX) have very good quick-starts on the language.

ahh, I see... I thought he meant from scratch... All I know is REALBasic...
