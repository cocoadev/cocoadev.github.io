Hi.

I'd like to know how Apple gets those crisp strings drawn when moving the mouse above a Dock tile. Note that I'm not interested in the backdrop, the rounded rect the string's written in.
I tried several attributes, but never even got close to those good-looking strings the Dock displays... Any help is greatly appreciated.

Just looks like white text with a dark gray outline to me. You can set the outline colour attribute on an NSAttributedString. --GC

Yup, that's it. I thank you kindly.
