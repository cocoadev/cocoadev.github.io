General/SwitchControl is an open-source control based on the General/TimeMachine.prefPane 'big button' hosted at http://code.google.com/p/switchcontrol. It's also resolution independent as all the drawing is done at runtime.

The control only exposes a single binding; General/NSValueBinding expecting an General/NSNumber wrapping a BOOL.

General/SwitchControl is dependent on another one of my projects Amber.framework which is available at http://code.google.com/p/amber-framework.
