Framework introduced in 10.2, allows unloading, reloading of airport driver. Work is under way at http://www.dopesquad.net/security/ to develop a monitor mode driver, and here http://www.binaervarianz.de/projekte/programmieren/kismac/ is a project aimed at a network scanner.

Anyone have any other information on this framework? Neither of the above projects have released source to the public yet.
