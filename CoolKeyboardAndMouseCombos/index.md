**XCode Keyboard Shortcuts and Mouse tricks**


*Large Method/Function/PragmaMark menus can be scrolled with a scroll wheel by single clicking the popup menu without dragging (i.e. click down on the popup menu and release without moving the mouse). This action will keep the menu open so you can scroll through the menu with a scroll wheel or a mighty mouse. (9/3/07)


**PB Keyboard Shortcuts and Mouse tricks**


*To toggle back and forth between the header and source file use COMMAND + OPTION + UpArrow
*To jump to the implementation of a method just COMMAND + Click on the method name
*To execute a shell command with a file, start at the begining of the line and type a command like "pwd" and then hit CONTROL + "r"  (also see ProjectBuilderShell)
*To rename an item in the project list, option-click on it


**IB Keyboard Shortcuts and Mouse tricks**


*To copy an interface element (e.g. an NSButton), just OPTION + drag the item 
*To move an element across views (e.g. from an NSBox into another NSWindow), click and hold the element without moving the mouse. In about a second, a shadow will appear under the element, and you are free to drag it wherever you please (it also keeps it's binding if it has one)



**New to Jaguar**


*here's a little tid-bit i found in the universal acces system preference. it isn't really easter egg but it was unknown to me that it could be done.  it is called the zoom feature: option + command + *(8) turns on the zoom from any where. pressing option + command + +(plus) or - (minus) you can zoom in and out on the active desktop. i'm sure isn't really anything new, but it's rather fun to play with, especially with pictures. Greystroke (12/16/02) 
*To swich the display to B&W press control+option+command+(the times sign on the num pad)
See ControlCommandOptionAsterisk for how to invert the display in color mode!
 *Quick Key to take a snapshot / screenshot of a portion of your display!! 
  
 Here's a cool trick MrNivit1 (11/26/02) stumbled upon while messing around with keyboard combinations. Hold down command-shift-4 and the cursor will turn into a target. Select an area of the screen (i.e. click, drag to draw a box, release) and a new graphic file with an image of the area you selected will appear on the desktop (if the picture file isn't automatically placed on your desktop check your "Desktop" folder in your home directory for the file). MrNivit guesses Apple was kind enough to bring this easter egg from OS9 (apple-shift-3 will give you a picture of the entire screen in OS9) to OSX.  

If you press command-shift-4 and the press space, the window under the mouse can be snapshotted (it will turn blue).
 * Jaguar Global Keyboard shortcut 
  
 Cmd-` (*), as of 10.2, is reserved by Apple for cycling through an application's windows. This keystroke combo works everywhere, even overriding some applications' use of the keystroke combo (see also, Adobe Photoshop. Adobe posted a patch for PS which \"unhooks\" this keystroke for PS users accustomed to using it.)

(*) on a german keyboard, try Cmd-< and Shift-Cmd-< instead

  
*keyboard shortcuts in Jaguar finder 
  
*To open Application folder (Jaguar) 
 Command + Shift + A  
*To open Favorites folder (Jaguar) 
 Command + Shift + F 
  

  
**Terminal**


  
*open a terminal window (start a session) 
*if you want to change the working directory to a directory that is deep in many folders: 

*type cd followed by a space. 
*click on an active finder window and drag and drop the folder onto the terminal window. 
*smile after you see the full path automatically filled in after %:cd 
  
*you can do this with any command line tool, like if 
      you wanted to open a file in vi, just type vi(space)  
      and drag and drop the file onto the terminal window. 
  
  
**Start Up**

  
*Command + "V" pressed while Mac OS X boots will show 
 a text screen that scrolls boot status info. (Macworld's 50 Top Mac OS X Tips) 
[I always boot up like this. You can see fsck running, etc. If you hold it down at startup 
It also switches to a text screen when your comp is about to shut down or restart. Now 
you, too, can make your Mac look like DOS!]
  
*Command + "S" pressed while Mac OS X boots will scroll boot 
 info and then stop with a command prompt (just like a command prompt in 
 a terminal window). You can login from here before Aqua loads. 
    
**Finder Window**

*>>NEW!! just figured this one out 6/18/03. You can scroll horizontally with the scroll wheel of your mouse (if you have one) by holding the shift key down as you scroll. This one is really useful for a column view when you are deep within the file system. This trick works for any NSScrollView in case you were wondering :-)
*The option key changes some Finder Menu Items in real time. 
 
*Home (Command + Shift + H) 
*Computer (Command + Shift + C) 
*iDisk (Command + Shift + I) 
*Click on the "File" Menu and leave it pulled down. 
*Press the option key, and watch the Close Window menu item 
         change to Close All in real time. 
      note: try this in the Window Menu. (Macworld's 50 Top Mac OS X Tips) 
   
*To select a group of files that appear together in a list view: 
 
*Click on first file of group 
*Shift + Click on last file of group 
   
*To select a group of files that do not appear together in a list view: 
 
*Command + Click on any file that you want to 
                      select/deselect into or out of a group 
*Repeat Step 1 to add/remove any file to or from the group 
*Command + Drag selects/deselects items the mouse 
                       arrow moves over 
                  
                   note: Holding the Command key down forces all items 
                            to freeze so that items can only be selected/deselected 
                            with the mouse and not moved around. 
   
*To turn the mouse arrow into a mouse hand (like the hand in 
 Photoshop): 
     
	Option + Click in any "white space" of a Finder Window 
         in listview mode, then drag the contents around 
         (Klink 4/23/01) 
  
   
**Finder Window Toolbar**
 
  
*To move/remove item in toolbar: 
                   Command + Click + Drag 
  
*To edit toolbar: 
                   Shift + Click top right button in Finder Window 
    
**Any Toolbar**
 
  
*The "toolbar button" is the oblong button at the right end of the title bar.  Click to hide/show toolbar.
  
*To edit the toolbar: 
                   Command + Option + Click the toolbar button
(except in the Finder, where it's "shift".)
  
*To change toolbar appearance (big/small icons/text) : 
                   Command + Click top right button in Finder Window to cycle through the various combinations
(shift-command to cycle backwards).  OR, right-click anywhere in the toolbar -- I just discovered this today!
    
**Internet Explorer**

          
  
*To change the mouse arrow into a hand in a window (like 
 the photoshop hand) so you can move the page around: 
    Command + Drag 
  
 note: This feature was in IE before the Mac OS X version, but 
 I just wanted to point it out. I hope Apple gets all developers 
 to agree on a uniform method to convert the mouse arrow to 
 a hand. Just a thought because this method beats scoll bar 
 arrows hands down ;-) 
    
**Any Window**

  
 I just found a great way to hide XDarwin without having 
 to use a command key or to select Hide XDarwin from the XDarwin 
 menu. Just hold the option key down while you click on another window 
 or the desktop.  
              
*To minimize all windows owned by a particular application at once: 
                   Option + Minimize (yellow minus button)
  
*To move/resize/scroll a window that is behind an active window 
 without changing the statis of the active window (endian 4/23/01)          
      Command + Click on the control of the background window 

*note 1: to move a window in background, Command + Drag 
                   the title bar of the background window.  
*note 2: resizing and scrolling in background doesn't always 
                   work 
    
  
 You can set the scroll bar behavior in the System Preferences 
 window to either jump to a location in the scroll bar or to jump 
 one page up or down, but both options are available to you 
 all the time. The opposite behavior of what you set in your System  
 Preferences can be performed by holding the Option key down 
 when you click on the scroll bar. (Matt/VGZ 4/23/01) 
    
**Dock**

  
*To freeze dock items so that they do not move around when you want to drop an item onto an icon in the dock: 
                    Command + Option + Drag item onto dock item              
  
                    note: this method forces an application to attemp to 
                           open an item dropped onto the application's 
                             icon in the dock  
  
 To get any item in the Dock to pop open a menu (Folder/HD icons  
 pop open a quasi AppleMenu, applications pop open a menu with  
 options to quit, show or select a window and the trash can pops  
 open the option to empty):  
                    Control + Click on the Dock icon  
  
                    note: click/hold on any item in the Dock does the same thing,  
                              but this is a bit slower 
  
*To have the Finder show you where a dock item is located: 
                    Command + Click item 
  
*To hide all other windows and show the windows of a running application: 
                   Command + Option + Click on the application icon in the dock 
  
*To hide the windows of the application in foreground and bring the windows of another application into foreground: 
                 Option + Click on the application icon in the dock 
  
                   note: This allows you to switch between two applications       
               without hiding things like Finder Windows or the  
               Internet Connect status window. 

* To force quit an application from the dock: 
                   Option + Right Click or Option + Control + Left Click on the application icon in the Dock.
                    A 'Force Quit' menu item will replace the usual 'Quit' item in the application's Dock menu
