You can create action methods using either Xcode (or Project Builder) or Interface Builder.

To create an action method in Interface Builder you go to the MainMenu.nib window and go to the classes tab.  Find the class that you want to add your action method to.  Highlight the class.  Open the info panel (shift-apple-I).  Choose the action tab.  Click the "add" button.  Highlight the newly created action method and rename it to whatever you like.

To create an action method in Xcode (or Project Builder) see HowToMakeAnActionMethod.
