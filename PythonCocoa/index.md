Like RubyCocoa, but for Python... 

... uh, no, RubyCocoa came well after PythonCocoa.   In particular, PyObjC was started in 1994 and has been in various states of active ever since.  Recently, development on PyObjC has been very active and a 1.0 was released (Fall 2003).  You can develop full featured Cocoa applications using Python, including subclassing Objective-C in Python and full fledged support for NIB files.
