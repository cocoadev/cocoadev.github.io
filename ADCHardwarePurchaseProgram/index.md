From Apple's page:

*The ADC Hardware Purchase Program allowed ADC Members with ADC Hardware Discount assets to purchase Apple hardware for development or testing purposes at a significant discount. These discounts are included in Premier membership, Select membership, and occasionally as part of special promotions.*

As of March 2010 **Apple no longer offers hardware discounts**.
