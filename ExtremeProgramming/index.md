I *believe* that ExtremeProgramming has to do with taking your PowerBook rock-climbing. Or maybe it should be called EffectiveProgramming instead :) -- RobRix

See http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgramming.  The PortlandPatternRepository is where most discussion regarding XP, as it is called, takes place.  KentBeck and RonJeffries, while working on ChryslerComprehensiveCompensation(or C3), invented this particular methodology.  ExtremeProgramming emphasises:


*UnitTest
*ReFactoring
*YouArentGonnaNeedIt
*OnceAndOnlyOnce
*OptimizeLater
*ContinuousIntegration
*TheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork
