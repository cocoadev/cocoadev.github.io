Does some body know how to create a NSTextView who contains HTML source code with colors for each tags ? OmniGroup's frameworks maybe do it but which ones ?
Thanks.

I think you can use the method discussed in ImplementSyntaxHighlighting.

Do the OmniGroup's frameworks include HTML syntax highlighting?

Not that I'm aware of, but IDEKit does (GPL)
