After a large amount of posting with essentially no profile, I've finally decided to write something about myself!

I'm a second semester Sophomore (Yay for AP credits!) at Macalester College in Minnesota, USA.  I'm majoring in Computer Science and Linguistics, with a minor in Mathematics.  I've been using Macs since the Apple ][ I had when I was 3.  In fact, I can still remember playing with that Apple ][ before I could read what it said.

I'm currently working on an Independent Project with compiler frontends.  So if you need any help with LL-parsers, ask me!

I've been absent for a while, but back in the day I floated by this website fairly regularly looking for interesting discussions or tidbits.  Now that I've got a bit more free time on my hands, I'm hoping to get back to being a regular reader.

As of the moment I code for free, and I'm willing to help out with any OpenSource or Freeware apps that people need help with.
