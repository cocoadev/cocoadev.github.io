Writing a simple a RPG engine that uses two documents, a database of monsters and a document representing the player. Ran into something of a problem, though, with how I was planing to have the monster document act. I'd like to have it work somewhat like Travel Advisor or Expense from Learning Cocoa's window does- make all monster documents open in the same window, requiring the last to be closed/asked if it is to be saved before a new one can be opened. Is it possible to do this with the General/NSDocument format, or should the monster document act differently? Found one post to General/OmniGroup's list about this, but was unable to glean anything from it- [newbie alert] only one document open at any time. Any pointers would be very helpful.
