Can selecting a value in an NSPopupButton who's contentValues are bound to an NSArrayController's arrangedObjects change which object in the NSArrayController's contentArray is being selected?

How can I do this?

Got it!  I forgot to bind the selectedIndex of the NSPopupButton to the selectionIndex of the NSArrayController.
