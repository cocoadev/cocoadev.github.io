An InstanceMethod is a function that AnObject can perform, commonly on or with a DataMember.

An InstanceMethod must be invoked on an actual instance of the receiving class.  This is what distinguishes it from a ClassMethod.

A method is similar to a C function, except that it can only be performed by sending an ObjectMessage to an object that implements it, which is central to the modularization that ObjectOrientedDesign provides.
