Hi!




I recently stumbled across the NSPreferences page here, and I'm confused on how to use it. I've looked at Collquy's code since it uses NSPreferences, but that didn't help too much -

If somebody could create an example project on how to use NSPreferences with a little explanation I'd be eternally grateful, and probably create an entire page on my website (as well as here) on how to use it -





Thank you,
JohnWells
