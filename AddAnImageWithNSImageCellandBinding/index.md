title: AddAnImageWithNSImageCellandBinding

How do I load an Image into an NSImageCell.?
I want to add an NSImage I open previously to a Table using an NSTableController.

I want to build an application just like the binding example on
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaBindings/Tasks/images.html 

Thanx Alex
